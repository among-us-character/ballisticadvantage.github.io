										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tropical Merge: A Fun and Relaxing Merge Game</h2>
<p>Tropical Merge is a merge game where you can build your own tropical paradise by matching various resources in groups of three or more. The game is developed by Clever Apps Pte. Ltd. and is available for free on web browsers, Facebook, and mobile devices. In this article, we will review some of the features and gameplay of Tropical Merge and why you should give it a try.</p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://www.virlan.co/games/best-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 30 Best Indie Games : Stardew Valley, Celeste, Hades, Cuphead and more</a></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build your tropical paradise</strong>: Tropical Merge features hundreds of tropical objects that you can combine with other items in groups of three or more. Merging these items creates an entirely new object that can be further upgraded by merging it with two others of the same kind. For example, you can merge three coconuts to make a palm tree, then merge three palm trees to make a hut, and so on. Each upgrade becomes more valuable and beautiful as you continue to build your tropical paradise.</li>
<li><strong>Explore and expand to new areas</strong>: As you progress in the game, you can earn amulets and level up to unlock more areas and expand your island. The more areas you open, the more freedom you have to merge and build until you’ve created the perfect utopian island society. There are all kinds of rarities and unlockable items scattered around the map for you to find on your adventure, such as exotic animals, magical gardens, and even dragons.</li>
<li><strong>Complete quests</strong>: Merging and discovering new items is great fun, and many are part of quests that will reward you for building new items. There are so many quests to keep you hooked, and daily quests to keep you coming back for a fresh challenge. You can also earn coins and gems by completing quests, which you can use to buy more items or speed up the merging process.</li>
<li><strong>Play online or offline</strong>: Tropical Merge is a game that you can play anytime and anywhere, whether you have an internet connection or not. You can play on your web browser, Facebook, or mobile device, and your progress will be saved across all platforms. You can also invite your friends to play with you and share your island creations with them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Tropical Merge is a game that is easy to learn but hard to master. The gameplay is simple: you just drag and drop items on the island to merge them with other items of the same kind. You can also tap on an item to move it to an empty space or swap it with another item. The game will give you hints on what items can be merged and what items they will produce.</p>
<p>The game also has some strategic elements that make it more challenging and fun. For example, you have to manage your space wisely, as you can only merge items that are adjacent to each other. You also have to balance your resources, as some items are more rare and valuable than others. You also have to watch out for obstacles, such as rocks or clouds, that may block your merging path.</p>
<p>The game has a relaxing and soothing atmosphere, with colorful graphics, cute animations, and calming music. The game also has a day-night cycle that changes the mood and appearance of your island. You can also customize your island with different themes and decorations that suit your style.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Tropical Merge is a game that will appeal to anyone who loves merging games, farming games, or puzzle games. It is a game that will keep you entertained for hours with its endless possibilities of merging and building. It is also a game that will help you relax and unwind with its tropical vibes and soothing sounds.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a fun and relaxing merge game that will transport you into a fantasy world of adorable animals, magical gardens, and dragons, then Tropical Merge is the game for you.</p>

<p>Happy Room is a physics-based puzzle game that revolves around torturing a hapless dummy in increasingly creative ways. The game is deceptively simple, but it offers a surprising amount of depth and challenge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>



<p>The goal of Happy Room is to use a variety of weapons and traps to kill the dummy in as many different ways as possible. The game is split into two main modes: Campaign and Sandbox.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Campaign Mode</strong></h2>



<p>Campaign mode presents a series of challenges that gradually increase in difficulty. Each challenge has a specific goal, such as killing the dummy with a certain weapon or in a certain way. Completing challenges earns you money, which can be used to unlock new weapons, traps, and decorations for your room.</p>



<p>Campaign mode is a great way to learn the ropes of the game and to experience the wide variety of challenges that Happy Room has to offer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sandbox Mode</strong></h2>



<p>Sandbox mode gives you complete freedom to build your own rooms and experiment with different ways to kill the dummy. You can place any of the weapons, traps, and decorations that you have unlocked, and you can even create your own physics objects from scratch.</p>



<p>Sandbox mode is a great way to let your creativity run wild and to create some truly outlandish and hilarious kill rooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>



<p>Happy Room features a wide variety of weapons, each with its own unique properties. Some weapons are designed for quick and efficient kills, while others are more for inflicting maximum pain and suffering.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the weapons available in Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lasers:</strong> These can be used to cut the dummy in half or to disintegrate it entirely.</li>



<li><strong>Explosives:</strong> These can be used to blow the dummy up in a variety of spectacular ways.</li>



<li><strong>Traps:</strong> These can be used to catch the dummy off guard and inflict damage in unexpected ways.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Traps</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to weapons, Happy Room also features a variety of traps that can be used to kill the dummy. Traps can be triggered by the dummy&#8217;s movement, or they can be set off manually.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the traps available in Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Spikes:</strong> These can impale the dummy if it touches them.</li>



<li><strong>Pitfalls:</strong> These can drop the dummy into a deadly abyss. </li>



<li><strong>Grinders:</strong> These can slowly grind the dummy to pieces.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Decorations</strong></p>



<p>In addition to weapons and traps, Happy Room also features a variety of decorations that can be used to customize your room. Decorations can be purely aesthetic, or they can have a gameplay impact, such as slowing down the dummy&#8217;s movement or increasing the damage of weapons.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the decorations available in Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Candles:</strong> These can be used to create a spooky atmosphere.</li>



<li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> These can block the dummy&#8217;s path and force it to take different routes.</li>



<li><strong>Power-ups:</strong> These can temporarily give the dummy enhanced abilities, such as increased speed or invulnerability.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>



<p>Happy Room is a fun and addictive game that offers a surprising amount of depth and challenge. The physics-based gameplay is unique and satisfying, and the wide variety of weapons, traps, decorations, and challenges ensures that there is always something new to discover.</p>



<p>I highly recommend Happy Room to anyone who enjoys physics-based puzzles, creative problem-solving, or just plain old mayhem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guide to Play</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few tips for playing Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Experiment with different weapons and traps:</strong> There&#8217;s no right or wrong way to kill the dummy, so experiment with different combinations of weapons and traps to see what works best.</li>



<li><strong>Be creative:</strong> There are no limits to what you can do in Happy Room, so let your imagination run wild.</li>



<li><strong>Have fun:</strong> Happy Room is a game designed to be enjoyed, so relax and have some fun with it.</li>

<li>The game can be very frustrating and unfair at times, especially when the enemy has more powerful or expensive units than you or when your units behave stupidly or randomly.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #ff6600;">Monkey Mart Review</span></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been enjoying playing Monkey Mart for a while now on both mobile and browser. It&#8217;s a fun idle/simulation game where you run a supermarket for monkeys.</p>
<p>In the game, you plant various crops like banana, corn and wheat on your farm. You then harvest the fully grown crops and stock the shelves of your mart. Customers (other animal characters) will come to buy the items. You can stand at the register to collect money.</p>
<p>As you earn more cash, you can expand your mart by unlocking new aisles and hiring assistant monkeys to help maintain things. You can also buy appliances to make prepared foods from your harvests. There are options like yogurt maker, peanut butter maker and chocolate maker.</p>
<p>Over time you can build up to 3 different marts/branches across various locations. It&#8217;s satisfying to see your little Monkey Mart empire grow. The game provides a soothing yet engaging experience.</p>
<p>Some pros are the cute pixel graphics, relaxing gameplay loop and constant sense of progression. However, the mobile version does sometimes shower you with ads which interrupt gameplay. Also there isn&#8217;t a social element like interacting with friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Papas Cheeseria: A Fun and Cheesy Restaurant Game</h2>
<p>Papas Cheeseria is a fun and addictive online game that lets you run your own grilled cheese sandwich shop. It is part of the popular Papas series of restaurant games created by Flipline Studios, which includes titles such as Papas Freezeria, Papas Pizzeria, and Papas Cupcakeria.</p>
<p>In this game, you play as either Rudy or Scarlett, the winners of Papa Louie’s Next Chefs 2023 contest. You are hired to work at Papa’s Cheeseria, a new restaurant in Toastwood that specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches and fries. However, on your first day of work, you discover that someone has stolen your musical instruments. Now you have to earn enough money to buy new equipment and fulfill your dream of becoming a rock star.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Papas Cheeseria has four main stations: Order Station, Build Station, Grill Station, and Fry Station. You have to master each station to make delicious sandwiches and fries for your customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order Station</strong>: Here you take orders from the customers who enter the shop. You have to write down their preferences for bread, cheese, toppings, sauces, fries, and drinks. You also have to pay attention to their patience meter, which decreases over time. If it runs out, they will leave without paying.</li>
<li><strong>Build Station</strong>: Here you assemble the sandwiches according to the orders. You have to drag the bread slices onto the cutting board, add the cheese slices and toppings, and drizzle the sauces. You have to be careful not to add too much or too little of each ingredient, or the customers will be unhappy.</li>
<li><strong>Grill Station</strong>: Here you cook the sandwiches on the grill. You have to flip them at the right time and make sure they are evenly cooked on both sides. You also have to watch out for the grill temperature, which affects how fast the sandwiches cook. If you overcook or undercook them, the customers will complain.</li>
<li><strong>Fry Station</strong>: Here you prepare the fries and drinks for the orders. You have to drop the fries into the fryer and wait until they are golden and crispy. Then you have to season them with salt, cheese, bacon bits, or other toppings. You also have to fill the cups with soda, juice, or milkshakes. You have to be quick and accurate, or the customers will lose their patience.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you finish an order, you have to drag it to the pickup area and collect your tips. The customers will rate your performance based on how well you followed their instructions and how fast you served them. You can earn up to three stars for each order, depending on your score.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Papas Cheeseria has many features that make it an enjoyable and challenging game. Some of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customization</strong>: You can create your own character or choose one of the existing ones. You can also customize your appearance with different hairstyles, clothes, accessories, and hats. You can unlock new items by playing mini-games or earning badges.</li>
<li><strong>Mini-games</strong>: You can play various mini-games after each workday to earn prizes and bonuses. Some of the mini-games are Mitch’s Mess, Sundae Shot, Hallway Hunt, Rico’s Chiliworks, and Papa’s Raceway. Each mini-game has its own rules and objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades</strong>: You can use your tips to buy upgrades for your shop and improve your service. Some of the upgrades are new breads, cheeses, toppings, sauces, fries, drinks, posters, furniture, speakers, and instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Holidays</strong>: You can celebrate different holidays throughout the year with special ingredients and decorations. Some of the holidays are Starlight Jubilee, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s Eve, Valentine’s Day, St. Paddy’s Day, Easter, Cinco de Mayo, and Onionfest.</li>
<li><strong>Customers</strong>: You can serve over 100 different customers with unique personalities and preferences. Some of them are regulars who visit often and give generous tips. Some of them are closers who are very picky and hard to please. Some of them are special customers who only appear on certain days or events.</li>
