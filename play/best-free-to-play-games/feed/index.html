										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Stray Brothers 3D: A Fun and Cute Runner Game with Cats and Dogs</h2>
<p>If you are a fan of cats and runner games, you might want to check out Stray Brothers 3D, a new online game that lets you run around a course with a bunch of cats and fight against dogs. This game is inspired by Stray, the big indie Playstation hit from BlueTwelve Studio that won the hearts of many gamers with its immersive and realistic depiction of a catâ€™s life in a dystopian city.</p>
<p>Stray Brothers 3D is a simpler and more casual version of Stray, but it still offers plenty of fun and challenge for cat lovers. In this game, you control a stray cat that runs along a street full of obstacles, gates, and dogs. Your goal is to collect as many cat brothers as you can by passing through the gates that multiply or increase the number of cats you have. The more cats you have, the more power you have to fight the dogs that try to stop you.</p>
<p>The game has a 3D graphics style that is colorful and cartoonish, creating a contrast with the dark and gritty atmosphere of Stray. The cats and dogs are also cute and expressive, making the game more appealing and humorous. The game also has simple and intuitive controls: you just need to drag left and right with the mouse or with the finger to run with your cat, avoiding obstacles and hitting dogs along the way. At the end of each level, you need to tap fast to attack and punch the final boss dog and beat it. The more cats you have, the more bonus points you will also receive.</p>
<p>Stray Brothers 3D is a fun and addictive game that can keep you entertained for hours. It is also a great way to experience the thrill of being a cat in a hostile environment, without the risk of getting hurt or lost.</p>
