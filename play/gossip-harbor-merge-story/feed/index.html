<p>Block Champ is a fast-paced and addictive puzzle game that combines the classic gameplay of Tetris with a few unique twists. In this game, you are tasked with clearing rows and columns of blocks to score points and progress to higher levels. However, there are a few obstacles in your way, such as frozen tiles that require multiple line clears to remove and lightning tiles that can instantly clear entire rows or columns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>



<p>The gameplay of Block Champ is simple to learn but difficult to master. You are given a set of blocks that you can place anywhere on the 10&#215;10 grid. Once you have placed a block, you cannot move it, so you must carefully plan your placement to avoid getting stuck.</p>



<p>To clear a row or column, you must fill it completely with blocks of the same color. Once a row or column is cleared, it disappears from the board and you are rewarded with points. The more rows or columns you clear at once, the more points you earn.</p>



<p>In addition to clearing rows and columns, you can also earn points by collecting lightning tiles. Lightning tiles are special blocks that can instantly clear any rows or columns that they are in. Collecting two lightning tiles in the same row or column will instantly clear that row or column.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Obstacles</strong></h2>



<p>As you progress through the levels of Block Champ, you will encounter a few obstacles that will make the game more challenging. These obstacles include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Frozen tiles:</strong> Frozen tiles are blocks that cannot be cleared until they are part of a two-line clear. This can be a major challenge, as it can prevent you from clearing rows and columns and earning points.</li>



<li><strong>Power-ups:</strong> Power-ups are special items that can be used to give you a temporary advantage. There are a variety of power-ups available, such as bombs that can clear entire areas of the board, hammers that can break frozen tiles, and boosters that can increase your score multiplier.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategies</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few strategies that you can use to improve your gameplay in Block Champ:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Plan your moves:</strong> Before you place a block, take a moment to plan your next few moves. This will help you avoid getting stuck and will allow you to clear more rows and columns at once.</li>



<li><strong>Use lightning tiles wisely:</strong> Lightning tiles are powerful tools, but they should be used sparingly. Only use them when you are really stuck or when you have a good opportunity to clear a lot of rows or columns.</li>



<li><strong>Collect power-ups:</strong> Power-ups can be a lifesaver, so be sure to collect them whenever you see them. Use them strategically to give yourself a boost and to help you clear difficult levels.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Additional Tips</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start with a single color of blocks when you are first learning the game. This will make it easier to see where you can place the blocks.</li>



<li>Use the pause button if you need a few seconds to think about your next move.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment with different strategies. There is no one right way to play Block Champ.</li>
</ul>
