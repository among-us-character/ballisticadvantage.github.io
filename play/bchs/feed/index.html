										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Ludo With Friends: A Fun and Social Online Game</h2>
<p>Ludo is a classic board game that originated in India and has been played for centuries by people of all ages and backgrounds. Ludo is derived from the ancient game of Pachisi, which was played by the kings and queens of India. Ludo is a game of strategy, luck and skill, where four players compete to move their four pieces from their starting corner to the center of the board.</p>

<p>Ludo With Friends is an online version of Ludo that allows you to play with your friends or with strangers from around the world. You can choose from four different game modes: Play with Friends, Online Multiplayer, Local Multiplayer and Play with Computer. You can also customize your pieces and board with different colors and themes.</p>
<h2>How to Play Ludo With Friends</h2>
<p>To play Ludo With Friends, you need to have a device with an internet connection and a browser that supports HTML5. You can access the game for free at CrazyGames.com, ArcadeSpot.com or Kiz10.com. Alternatively, you can download the app for Android or iOS devices.</p>
<p>The game starts with each player choosing one of the four colors: red, blue, green or yellow. Each player has four pieces of the same color that start in their respective corner. The board consists of a square with a cross-shaped track, with a colored path leading to the center.</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to move all four of your pieces to the center of the board before your opponents do. To do this, you need to roll a six-sided die and move one of your pieces according to the number shown on the die. You can only move a piece out of your corner if you roll a six. If you roll a six, you get another turn.</p>
<p>You can move your piece along the track in a clockwise direction, following the arrows on the board. You can also take shortcuts by moving along the colored path of your own color. However, you cannot enter the center unless you roll the exact number required to land on it.</p>
<p>If your piece lands on a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, you capture their piece and send it back to their corner. This is called cutting. However, if your piece lands on a square occupied by one of your own pieces, they form a block that prevents your opponents from cutting them.</p>
<p>The game ends when one player moves all four of their pieces to the center of the board. The winner is the first player to do so. The remaining players can continue playing until all pieces have reached the center.</p>
