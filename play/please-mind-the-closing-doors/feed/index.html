										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capture new territories and defeat enemies in the new exciting game Paper.io 2. <br />Each player starts out with a small island, make it larger by adding new areas to it, but watch out for enemies. You are safe on your own turf but once you are outside you become vulnerable.</p>
<p>Protect your tail from opponents and don&#8217;t hesitate to counter attack!</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">paper.io 2 online</h2>


<p>Paper.io 2 is an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.voodoo.paper2&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a> multiplayer io Game where you capture as much territory as possible.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">paper.io 2 teams</h2>


<p>Experience a new era of .io multiplayer in the new Paper.io 2 Teams game mode.</p>
<p>Your task in the game Paper IO 2 is to control a colored square of your choice.</p>
<p>Use this block to move around the map to expand your area as much as possible. You can also take your own life at any time if the other person touches you. You may not run in line in your enclosure. The goal of the game is to occupy territory by creating rings complete with your snake.<br />This second version has smoother gameplay and animations, improved graphics with a realistic 3D platform. In addition, it also contains new interfaces and various challenges for you to explore the experience.</p>


<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1664087573999"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the difference between paper Io and Paper.io 2?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">If you are new to the name, Paper.io 2 plays just like its predecessor. The main difference between the two is that Paper.io 2 allows 360-degree movement of the player&#8217;s square, unlike the previous game that only allows the square to move in four directions—left, right, up, and down.</p> </div> </div>
