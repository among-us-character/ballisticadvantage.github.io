<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Drift Hunters unblocked</h2>


<p>Drift Hunters unblocked WTF is a free-to-play, browser-based drifting game that puts you behind the wheel of cars like the Toyota AE86, Nissan S13, Toyota Supra, Ford Mustang, and even the RWB 911.

Since it’s based on the UNITY engine, it does offer 3D graphics and the physics are somewhat realistic.</p>
<h2>How to Play Drift Hunters</h2>
<p>Gameplay is relatively simple. Use your keyboard’s ARROW KEYS to control the vehicle, the SPACEBAR to engage the handbrake, C to change the camera view. Left Shift and CTRL to upshift and downshift, respectively. While the handbrake is usually useful in games like this, you might find that you don’t need it as steering alone is usually enough to introduce a pretty wicked drift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sonic the Hedgehog: A Classic Game Review</h2>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game franchise that features a blue, anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic and his friends as they run, jump, spin and fight against the evil Dr. Eggman and his army of robots. The series was created by Sega in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular and influential games of all time.</p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://www.virlan.co/games/sega-confirms-plans-for-remakes-and-reboots-of-sonic-the-hedgehog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEGA Confirms Plans for Remakes and Reboots of Sonic the Hedgehog and Other Classic IPs</a></p>
<p>The first game in the series, Sonic the Hedgehog, was released for the Sega Genesis console in 1991 and introduced the basic gameplay mechanics that would define the series. The game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer that challenges the player to control Sonic as he speeds through seven zones, each with its own theme, enemies, obstacles and boss. The game also features a special stage that can be accessed by collecting 50 rings and jumping into a giant ring at the end of each level. In the special stage, Sonic has to navigate a rotating maze and collect six Chaos Emeralds, which are powerful gems that play a key role in the series’ lore.</p>
<p>The game was praised for its colorful graphics, catchy music, smooth animation and fast-paced gameplay that gave the player a sense of speed and freedom. The game also established Sonic as a charismatic and cool character with a rebellious attitude and a love for adventure. The game was a huge success and sold over 15 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling Sega Genesis game ever. The game also spawned several sequels, spin-offs, adaptations and merchandise that expanded the Sonic universe and its characters.</p>
<p>One of the most notable sequels is Sonic the Hedgehog 2, which was released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis. The game introduced Sonic’s sidekick and best friend, Tails, a two-tailed fox who can fly and follow Sonic in his adventures. The game also introduced the Spin Dash move, which allows Sonic to rev up and launch himself at high speed. The game also featured a multiplayer mode where two players can compete or cooperate as Sonic and Tails. The game was even more successful than the first one and sold over 18 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>Another sequel that is widely regarded as one of the best games in the series is Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis. The game continued the story from Sonic 2 and introduced Knuckles, a red echidna who guards the Master Emerald, a powerful gem that controls the Chaos Emeralds. Knuckles initially acts as an antagonist who is tricked by Dr. Eggman into believing that Sonic is his enemy, but later joins forces with him to stop Eggman’s plans. The game also featured a save system, a more complex level design, new power-ups and special stages that can be accessed by finding giant rings hidden in each level.</p>
<p>The Sonic series has also branched out into other genres and platforms over the years, such as racing games (Sonic R), fighting games (Sonic Fighters), puzzle games (Sonic Shuffle), adventure games (Sonic Adventure), role-playing games (Sonic Chronicles), sports games (Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games) and mobile games (Sonic Dash). Some of these games have been well-received by fans and critics, while others have been criticized for their poor quality, glitches or deviation from the original formula.</p>
<p>One of the most recent games in the series is Sonic Forces, which was released in 2017 for various platforms. The game features three gameplay modes: Classic Sonic, which is similar to the original 2D games; Modern Sonic, which is similar to the 3D games like Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Generations; and Avatar, which allows the player to create their own custom character and use different gadgets to assist Sonic. The game also features a multiplayer mode where players can race or battle against each other online or locally.</p>
<p>The game received mixed reviews from critics and fans, who praised its graphics, music and variety of gameplay modes, but criticized its short length, weak story, repetitive level design and lack of challenge. The game sold over one million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>The Sonic series has been one of the most influential and iconic video game franchises of all time, with over 920 million copies sold worldwide as of 2020. The series has also inspired numerous fan-made creations, such as hacks, mods, fan games, fan art, fan fiction and fan films. The series has also been adapted into various media forms, such as comics (Sonic the Comic), cartoons (Sonic X), anime (Sonic OVA), movies (Sonic the Hedgehog) and live shows (Sonic Live).</p>
<p>The series has also been recognized by various awards and honors, such as Guinness World Records (Fastest Video Game Character), Walk of Game (Lifetime Achievement Award) and World Video Game Hall of Fame (Inductee). The series has also been praised for its positive impact on the gaming industry and culture, as well as its social and environmental messages.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog is a classic game that has entertained and inspired millions of people around the world for over three decades. The game is still available to play on various platforms, such as mobile devices, online emulators or classic consoles. The game is also free to play on Google Play and App Store, as part of the Sega Forever collection. If you love classic games, you’ll love playing Sonic the Hedgehog!</p>
