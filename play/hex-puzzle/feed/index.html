<p>The 11-11 puzzle game is a simple but challenging puzzle game where players must place blocks on a board and group them to get points. The game is played on a 5&#215;5 grid, and players can place blocks in any empty square. Each block has a different shape, and players must try to group blocks together so that they form complete rows and columns.</p>



<p>When a row or column is completed, it disappears and the player earns points. The more blocks that are grouped together, the more points the player earns. The game ends when the player runs out of blocks or when they can no longer place any more blocks on the board.</p>



<p>The <strong>11-11 poki</strong> game is a great way to improve your problem-solving and spatial reasoning skills. It is also a very addictive game, and players can spend hours trying to beat their high score.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Tips for playing the 11-11 puzzle game:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Try to place blocks in the center of the board first. This will give you more options for grouping blocks together later in the game.</li>



<li>Look for opportunities to create multiple complete rows and columns at the same time. This will give you a big boost in points.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to undo your moves if you make a mistake. You can undo your last move by clicking on the undo button at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>Practice makes perfect! The more you play the game, the better you will become at it.</li>
</ul>
