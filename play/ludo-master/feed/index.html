<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ludo King : Play Online Ludo Game</h2>


<p>Ludo King is Most popular Ludo game on the world. You can Play Ludo King in online multiplayer mode. </p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ludo King Browser Game for Desktop</h2>


<p><strong>Ludo King</strong> is an Indian free-to-play mobile game application developed by Indian studio Gametion Technologies Pvt Ltd, based in Navi Mumbai, India.</p>
<p>Gametion is owned by Vikash Jaiswal. It is developed on the Unity game engine and is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludo.king&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/ludo-king/id993090598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>, Kindle, Windows Phone and Microsoft Windows platforms. The game is a modernization of the board game, Ludo, which in turn is based on the ancient Indian game of Pachisi.</p>
<h2>Ludo Game : Multiplayer Board Game.</h2>
<p>Before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ludo King</span>, Gametion primarily focused on developing browser games for desktop users. In 2013, the company shifted focus to mobile gaming. It published several games, including Snakes and Ladders and Baby’s Big Adventure, but these were all average. The company rose to prominence with the release of Ludo King.</p>
<h2>Ludo Game</h2>
<p><strong>ludo board game</strong> is a strategy <strong>board game</strong> for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi.<br />The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.</p>
<h2>Ludo Tricks &amp; Tips that will make you invincible at the game!</h2>
<p>The increasing popularity of ludo has led to the game being available at our fingertips, where we can play conveniently at any hour and against random players. When you play the traditional board game against the same players, you tend to identify their traits and form a strategy to win against them, and vice versa. <br />But if you <strong>play online</strong>, you are mostly competing against different players each time. How would you devise your strategy without knowing the player personally? This is where you can use the tips and tricks to become invincible in Ludo.</p>
<p>Here are essential ludo <a href="https://www.mpl.live/blog/ludo-tips-tricks-make-you-invincible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tips</a> and tricks you can implement in the next game you play and come out as a winner.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffff99;">Open all the coin pieces</span></p>
<p>One of the first ludo tricks towards your winning strategy is to get all your coins out of the home base at the earliest.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffff99;">Spread your coins on the board</span></p>
<p>If you want a strategic advantage in a ludo match, you should focus on spreading your coins across the board.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffff99;">Adopt an attacking strategy</span></p>
<p>Attacking opponents is the most thrilling part of playing ludo, even when you put your coins at risk.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffff99;">Patience is the key</span></p>
<p>Being patient is one of the key ludo tips in winning the game. For instance, if your coins are on the board’s star-shaped zones, your opponents cannot kill your coins in those zones.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffff99;">Block your opponent</span></p>
<p>Distracting your opponent is a trick of getting your coin safely to enter the home. When any of your coins are nearing your home, your opponents will always eye that piece and aim to capture it.</p>
