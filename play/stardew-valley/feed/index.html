<h2><span style="color: #ff9900;">Why PBS Kids is so popular?</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>PBS Kids is the brand for most of the children&#8217;s programming aired by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some public television children&#8217;s programs are not produced by PBS member stations or transmitted by PBS.</p>
<p>Instead, they are produced by independent public television distributors such as American Public Television, and are not labeled as &#8220;PBS Kids&#8221; programming, as it is mainly a programming block branding.</p>
<p>The target audience is <strong>children</strong> between the ages of 2 and 8. The network is also available in sub-Saharan Africa and Australia.</p>
