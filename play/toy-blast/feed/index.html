<p>Bejeweled Classic is a puzzle game developed and published by PopCap Games. It was released for Windows in 2001 and has since been ported to numerous other platforms, including macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.</p>



<p>The game is played on a grid of seven columns and seven rows, with each cell containing a colored gem. The goal of the game is to swap adjacent gems to create rows or columns of three or more identical gems. When this is done, the gems disappear and are replaced by new gems. The player continues swapping gems until they can no longer make any more matches.</p>



<p>The game has several different modes, including Classic, Lightning, Diamond Mine, Zen, and Butterfly. Classic mode is the standard game mode, where the player is given a limited amount of time to make as many matches as possible. Lightning mode is a timed mode where the player must make matches as quickly as possible. Diamond Mine mode is a mode where the player must dig down to find diamonds. Zen mode is a relaxation mode where the player has no time limit and can play at their own pace. Butterfly mode is a mode where the player must save butterflies from a hungry spider.</p>



<p>Bejeweled Classic is a simple but addictive game that has been enjoyed by millions of people around the world. It is a great game to play for people of all ages and skill levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform:capitalize">tips for playing Bejeweled Classic:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Look for opportunities to create cascades.</strong> A cascade is a chain reaction where one match triggers another match, and so on. Cascades can be very rewarding, as they can lead to high scores and bonuses.</li>



<li><strong>Use special gems wisely.</strong> Special gems, such as hypercubes and flame gems, can be very helpful in creating matches and clearing the board.</li>



<li><strong>Pay attention to the board.</strong> The board is constantly changing, so it is important to be aware of the different patterns and combinations that are forming.</li>



<li><strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment.</strong> There is no one right way to play Bejeweled Classic. Try different strategies and see what works best for you.</li>
