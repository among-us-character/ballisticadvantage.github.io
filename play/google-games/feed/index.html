<p>Snakes and Circles is a fun and fast-paced game of avoiding, chasing, colors and fun.</p>
<p>It is an endless racer-style game that only ends when you die and you only die when you screw up, so, don&#8217;t screw up.</p>
<h2>Play the best snake games for free</h2>
<h2>Snake video game</h2>
<h6>Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself.</h6>
<p>The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade from Gremlin Industries, and the ease of implementation has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms.</p>
<p>1982&#8217;s Tron arcade game, based on the film, includes snake gameplay for the single-player Light Cycles segment. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in snake games as it found a larger audience. There are several hundred snake games for iOS alone.</p>
<h2>Snakes and Circles is a free-avoider game</h2>
<p>You are a <strong>snake</strong> made out of an infinite series of glowing orbs.</p>
<p>Your only goal in life is to feast upon circles of light that are the same color as you, it sounds easy but as you slither through life you will encounter horizontal beams of light which will alter your very being.</p>
<p>As you pass through the horizontal beams of light you will take on their color. In doing so this means that you will change colors and thus be forced to consume the glowing circles of that new color.</p>
<p>You will have to change course mid-slither in order to survive for if you were to accidentally lose track of your own hue then you might eat the wrong color and die. Boom. Game over and no points. So, pay attention.</p>

<h2>What is the best version of snake game?</h2>
<h6>Best Snake Games for Android and iOS</h6>
<h3>Snake Game</h3>
<p>Snake Game is one of the best snake games for Android and iOS users because of two reasons. One is that it comes with the classic snake game that you used to play on your old feature phone. And two is that you can also choose to play it in yellow and old Nokia style backgrounds. A true classic feeling fitting for a retro game like Snake.</p>
<h3>Slither</h3>
<p>Slither is modern-day version of the snake game with a twist. The graphics are awesome, the snakes are colorful, and it comes with a multiplayer mode. That means you can now play with your friends and compete with them for supremacy. Find out who has the longest tail in the game.</p>
<h3>Snake vs Block</h3>
<p>Snake vs Block takes the good old game of snake for Android and iOS and turns it on its head. There is a snake made of balls that’s hungry and looking for food (balls) to grow. But then there are these obstacles in the form of blocks made of bricks that are stopping it. Your objective is to break as many blocks as possible while eating your favorite food.</p>
<h3>Snake 97</h3>
<p>Missing your old Nokia feature phone? Snake 97 comes with a layout that will make you feel nostalgic. The better part of the screen is covered in what appears to be a shell of Nokia 3310 with buttons. Then there is a small green background of a screen where you will play the OG snake game.</p>
<h3>Snake Candy</h3>
<p>Snake Candy is another snake game for Android and iOS where you will be competing against your friends. The objective is to have the longest tail in the game possible. Because the snake is made of candies, you will have to find and eat as many candies as possible to grow.</p>
<h3>Snakes and Apples</h3>
<p>The last but not the least is a true snake game for Android and iOS and I will explain why. What do snakes do? They dig holes to live in them. Snakes and Apples take inspiration from real life to create a forest where a snake has dug multiple holes around apple cultivation.</p>


<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1647353265071"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What happens at the end of snake game?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The game continues until the snake &#8220;dies&#8221;. A snake dies by either (1) running into the edge of the board, or (2) by running into its own tail. The final score is based on the number of apples eaten by the snake.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1647353328534"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the snake game everyone&#8217;s playing?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">With the evolution of phones and the internet, the game also evolved into a more modern title namely Slither.io, easily available to everyone, be on a smartphone or a PC. Much like the classic snake game, Slither.io includes a snake that consumes dots to grow longer.</p> </div> </div>
