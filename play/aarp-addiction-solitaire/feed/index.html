<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to play Golf Solitaire</h2>



<p>Golf Solitaire is a popular single-player card game that is easy to learn but challenging to master. The goal of the game is to move all of the cards from the seven tableau piles to the waste pile in ascending or descending order, regardless of suit.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Setup</strong></p>



<p>To set up the game, deal seven piles of cards face up, with five cards in each pile. The remaining cards are placed face down to form the stock.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>



<p>To start the game, turn over the top card of the stock pile and place it face up on the waste pile. Then, you can start moving cards from the tableau piles to the waste pile in ascending or descending order, regardless of suit. For example, if the top card on the waste pile is a 6, you can move a 7 or a 5 to the waste pile.</p>



<p>You can also move cards from one tableau pile to another. To do this, the card being moved must be one number higher or lower than the top card of the pile it is being moved to, and the two cards must be of the same suit. For example, if the top card of one tableau pile is a 7 of spades, you can move a 6 of spades or an 8 of spades to that pile.</p>



<p>If you cannot move any more cards, turn over the next card from the stock pile and place it face up on the waste pile. If the stock pile runs out of cards, you can shuffle the waste pile and place it face down to form a new stock pile.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Winning the game</strong></p>



<p>The game is won when all of the cards have been moved from the tableau piles to the waste pile.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Tips and strategies</strong></p>



<p>Here are a few tips and strategies for playing Golf Solitaire:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Try to keep the tableau piles organized. This will make it easier to find the cards you need to move.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to shuffle the waste pile. This can help you to get the cards you need to move.</li>



<li>If you get stuck, take a break and come back to the game later. Sometimes, all you need is a fresh perspective to see the next move.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>



<p>There are a few variations of Golf Solitaire. For example, some people play with a rule that you can only move a card from the tableau pile if it is the only card in that pile. Others play with a rule that you cannot shuffle the waste pile.</p>



<p>You can also make the game more challenging by playing with a larger number of decks of cards. This will make it more difficult to find the cards you need to move.</p>



<p>No matter how you play it, Golf Solitaire is a fun and challenging card game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
