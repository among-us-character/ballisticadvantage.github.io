<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Granny: A Creepy Escape Room in Video Game Form</h2>



<p>Granny is a jump-scare fueled horror game that puts you in a desperate fight for survival. </p>



<p>You wake up trapped in a creepy old house with a not-so-friendly granny hot on your heels. With excellent sound design and a tense atmosphere, Granny will have you on the edge of your seat, frantically searching for clues and hiding from your pursuer.</p>



<p>The core gameplay is suspenseful sneaking and puzzle solving. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to scour the house for items and tools to unlock doors and progress. But be warned, Granny has super hearing and will come running at any sound of a dropped object or a creaky floorboard. This constant threat keeps the tension high and makes every move feel risky.</p>



<p>The game offers multiple difficulty settings, with a practice mode that lets you explore the house without Granny chasing you. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the layout and plan your escape strategy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Play Granny</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stay Quiet:</strong> This is rule number one! Move slowly, avoid knocking things over, and crouch to muffle your footsteps.</li>



<li><strong>Listen Up:</strong> Granny&#8217;s footsteps are your early warning system. Use them to track her movements and plan your hiding spots.</li>



<li><strong>Think Like a MacGyver:</strong> You&#8217;ll often need to improvise tools by combining everyday objects.</li>



<li><strong>Explore Every Nook and Cranny:</strong> Keys, tools, and other helpful items are hidden throughout the house.</li>



<li><strong>Use Your Inventory Wisely:</strong> Some items have multiple uses, so plan ahead before using them.</li>



<li><strong>The Clock is Ticking:</strong> You only have five days (in-game time) to escape. Don&#8217;t waste time wandering aimlessly.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Weapons and crucial objects inside Granny’s house</h2>



<p>You can use these items only once per game and for specific purposes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Winch Handle = draw the bucket from inside the well in the Backyard.</li>



<li>The Padlock Code and The Battery = open a special lock on the Main Door.</li>



<li>The Remote Control = open the closet under the stairs in the Main Hallway.</li>



<li>The Cogwheels = open the Cogwheel Safe inside the Playhouse in the Backyard.</li>



<li>The Wrench = install the Car Engine part.</li>



<li>The Car Engine = escape via the car.</li>



<li>The Spark Plug = escape by car. </li>



<li>The Car Battery = place inside the car for one possible escape route. </li>



<li>The Meat = distract Granny’s playful Spider.</li>



<li>The Bird Seed = distract the crow in the Crow Room to obtain the item from the cage. </li>



<li>The Melon = provides several items.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>A Few Extra Tips:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The teddy bear you find throughout the house can act as a decoy to distract Granny.</li>



<li>The lockpicks you find are fragile. Use them only when absolutely necessary.</li>



<li>If you get caught, there might be ways to escape Granny&#8217;s grasp&#8230;but be quick!</li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Granny is a thrilling horror game that will test your nerves and puzzle-solving skills. With a good dose of patience, resourcefulness, and maybe a little bit of luck, you just might make it out alive!</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Please note:</strong> This game can be quite scary, so it may not be suitable for younger players or those who don&#8217;t enjoy horror games.</p>
