<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Play Nerdle Game : Fun and Daily Math Game Like Wordle</h2>


<h2>What is Nerdle game</h2>
<p>Nerdle is a fun, daily math game based on the immensely popular game <span style="color: #ff9900;"><a style="color: #ff9900;" href="https://www.virlan.co/game/category/wordle/"><strong>Wordle</strong></a></span>, except it challenges players to determine an equation instead of a five-letter word.</p>
<p>In it, you must guess an equation with eight characters within six guesses by using arithmetic characters from previous guesses as your clues.</p>
<figure id="attachment_521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-521" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-521" src="https://www.virlan.co/unblocked-games/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nerdle-the-daily-numbers-game.jpg" alt="Nerdle : the daily numbers game" width="700" height="425" srcset="https://www.virlan.co/unblocked-games/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nerdle-the-daily-numbers-game.jpg 700w, https://www.virlan.co/unblocked-games/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Nerdle-the-daily-numbers-game-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-521" class="wp-caption-text">Nerdle : the daily numbers game</figcaption></figure>
<h2>How to Play Nerdle Online</h2>
<p>Guess the NERDLE in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff9900;"><a style="color: #ff9900;" href="https://www.virlan.co/tech/how-to-play-nerdle-game-online-the-hard-daily-maths-puzzle-answer/">How To Play Nerdle Game Online?</a> </span></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to play Nerdle the Wordle maths spin off game</h2>
<p>Similar to Wordle when you make guesses the tiles will change colour to indicate if you’re right, wrong or in the wrong place. <br />Green tiles mean the number is correct and in the right place. Purple means it is in the solution but in the wrong place. If a tile turns black, it means it’s not in the word.</p>
<h2>Nerdle Game Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each guess is a calculation.</li>
<li>You can use 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + &#8211; * / or =.</li>
<li>It must contain one “=”.</li>
<li>It must only have a number to the right of the “=”, not another calculation.</li>
<li>Standard order of operations applies, so calculate * and / before + and &#8211; eg. 3+2*5=13 not 25!</li>
<li>If the answer we&#8217;re looking for is 10+20=30, then we will accept 20+10=30 too (unless you turn off &#8216;commutative answers&#8217; in settings).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Play Mini Nerdle</h2>
<p>mini nerdle rules are the same as the classic nerdle rules below except all calculations are just six tiles instead of eight. Smaller but no less tricky!</p>
<p>Guess the NERDLE in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the solution.</p>
<h2>play speed nerdle</h2>
<p>Speed Nerdle makes a hard game even harder: Solve number puzzles against the clock.</p>
<p>NERDLE gets another gameplay variant, as Speed Nerdle joins the likes of Mini Nerdle, Classic Nerdle, Instant Nerdle and Pro Nerdle.</p>
<p>Nerdle creator Richard Mann explains more: &#8220;The rules are the same as the classic nerdle, with the added challenge that players need to complete it as quickly as possible &#8211; a timer that appears in the middle of the screen to keep track.</p>
