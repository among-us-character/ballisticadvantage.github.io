<p>Sweet World is a match-3 puzzle game developed by TapLabGames. In the game, players travel through a magical candy land, solving puzzles by matching three or more identical candies. The game features over 1000 levels, with increasing difficulty.</p>



<p>To play Sweet World, players simply tap or click on two identical candies to connect them. If three or more candies are connected in a row, column, or diagonal, they will disappear, and new candies will fall into place. Players must clear all of the candies from the board to complete a level.</p>



<p>Sweet World includes a variety of power-ups and obstacles to make the game more challenging and interesting. For example, players can collect bombs to clear large areas of the board, or use lollipops to swap the positions of two candies. Players must also navigate around obstacles such as chocolate blockers and gingerbread men.</p>



<p>Sweet World is a fun and challenging puzzle game that is suitable for players of all ages. It is available to play for free on Poki and other websites.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size" style="text-transform:capitalize">tips for playing Sweet World:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Look for opportunities to create combos. Combos are created when two or more matching candies disappear at the same time. Combos can earn you extra points and power-ups.</li>



<li>Use power-ups wisely. Power-ups can help you to clear difficult levels or get out of sticky situations.</li>



<li>Plan your moves ahead of time. Don&#8217;t just make random matches. Try to think about how each move will affect the overall board.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to restart a level if you&#8217;re stuck. Sometimes the best way to beat a level is to start over with a fresh perspective.</li>
</ul>
