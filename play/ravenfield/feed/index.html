<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The game is divided into two modes: campaign and sandbox. In campaign mode, you have to complete a series of levels with increasing difficulty and unlock new units along the way. Each level has a fixed budget and a maximum number of units you can place on the battlefield. You can choose from a variety of units, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Some units are more effective against certain enemies than others, so you have to use your strategy and tactics to win.</p>
<p>In sandbox mode, you can create your own custom scenarios and battles with no limits. You can set up any combination of units on both sides and watch them fight in a chaotic and hilarious spectacle. You can also adjust the gravity, time scale, and other settings to make the game more fun and challenging.</p>
<p>The game features realistic ragdoll physics and beautiful graphics that make the battles more immersive and entertaining. You can also control the camera movement and zoom in or out to get a better view of the action. You can even take control of some units, such as Zeus, and use their special powers to turn the tide of the battle.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>

<li>Large-scale and spectacular battles</li>
<li>Unique and funny units</li>
<li>Ragdoll physics of enemies</li>
<li>Beautiful graphics</li>

<li>The game is very creative and original. You can find some unique and bizarre units that you wonâ€™t see in any other game, such as flying sharks or UFOs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>

<li>The game can be very repetitive and boring after a while, especially if you have unlocked all the units and completed all the levels.</li>
<li>The game can be very frustrating and unfair at times, especially when the enemy has more powerful or expensive units than you or when your units behave stupidly or randomly.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
