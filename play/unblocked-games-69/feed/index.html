<p>Super Mario Run is an auto-running platformer game developed and published by Nintendo for iOS and Android devices. Released in 2016, the game marked Nintendo&#8217;s first foray into the mobile gaming market. Super Mario Run takes the core gameplay elements of the classic Super Mario series and adapts them to a one-handed control scheme, making it perfect for casual on-the-go play.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>



<p>In Super Mario Run, players guide Mario through a series of levels, automatically running forward while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins. The game&#8217;s controls are simple yet intuitive, allowing players to tap the screen to make Mario jump and swipe left or right to change his direction. By carefully timing jumps and swipes, players can perform a variety of moves, such as long jumps, wall jumps, and even acrobatic tricks.</p>



<p>The game&#8217;s levels are designed in a way that encourages exploration and replayability. Hidden coins and collectibles are scattered throughout each level, rewarding players for their agility and willingness to experiment. Additionally, the game features three distinct modes: World Tour, Toad Rally, and Kingdom Builder, each offering unique gameplay experiences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Mario Run World Tour</h2>



<p>World Tour is the game&#8217;s main single-player mode, taking players through six worlds filled with classic Super Mario environments, such as grassy plains, underground caverns, and fiery castles. The goal of each level is to reach the end flag while collecting as many coins as possible. Along the way, players will encounter familiar enemies like Goombas, Koopa Troopas, and Bowser himself.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Toad Rally</strong></p>



<p>In Toad Rally, players compete against other players&#8217; ghost data in a series of procedurally generated levels. The goal is to score more points than the ghost by performing stylish moves, collecting coins, and reaching the end flag quickly. Toad Rally provides a unique asynchronous multiplayer experience, allowing players to compete at their own pace and compare their skills to others worldwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kingdom Builder</h2>



<p>Kingdom Builder is a creative mode where players use coins collected in World Tour and Toad Rally to build their own Mushroom Kingdom. A variety of buildings, decorations, and special structures are available for purchase, allowing players to personalize their kingdom and attract more Toads.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Super Mario Run Tips and Tricks</h2>



<p>Here are some tips and tricks to help you master Super Mario Run:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Timing is crucial:</strong> Carefully time your jumps to avoid obstacles and collect coins.</li>



<li><strong>Experiment with different moves:</strong> Try out different jump heights and swipes to discover new ways to navigate levels.</li>



<li><strong>Collect hidden coins:</strong> Keep an eye out for hidden coins and collectibles off the beaten path.</li>



<li><strong>Replay levels for better scores:</strong> Revisit completed levels to improve your coin collection and overall score.</li>



<li><strong>Practice stylish moves in Toad Rally:</strong> Toad Rally is a great place to practice stylish moves and earn more points.</li>



<li><strong>Expand your kingdom strategically:</strong> Plan your kingdom layout carefully to maximize space and attract more Toads.</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, Super Mario Run is an excellent mobile game that successfully captures the essence of the classic Super Mario series. With its simple yet engaging gameplay, charming visuals, and varied game modes, Super Mario Run is a must-play for any fan of platformers or casual gamers looking for a fun and addictive mobile experience.</p>

<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Talking Tom Gold Run has received positive reviews from critics and users alike. The game has a 4.3 star rating on Google Play Store and a 4.5 star rating on App Store. Some of the praises for the game are:</p>
<ul>
<li>“This game is better then subway surfers. I might get a lot of hate for saying that but it’s true. In subway surfers you just use coins to unlock characters. But in Tom gold run you have to build your house so it’s not as pay to win as subway surfers.” &#8211; I<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎beatsaber, App Store user</li>
<li>“It’s easy to use and control, I like the different environments to run in and it is smooth controlling the characters. I really only have a few complaints, one of them is that there are SO MANY ADDS and they are kind of overwhelming.” &#8211; Maurita Kovar, Google Play Store user</li>
<li>“Talking Tom Gold Run play free comes with the basic casual elements seen in most endless running games. The game starts with a brief tutorial followed by the main game itself. Talking Tom Gold Run is more than your average endless running title. The reason is the plethora of features packed in one package.” &#8211; Games.lol</li>
</ul>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Talking Tom Gold Run is a runner game that offers a lot of fun and entertainment for players who love Talking Tom and his friends. The game has high-quality graphics, music, sound effects, characters, worlds, outfits and power-ups that make it stand out from other runner games. The game also has different modes, challenges, rewards and online competitions that keep the players engaged and motivated. The game is free to download and play, but it also has in-app purchases for those who want to enhance their gaming experience. Talking Tom Gold Run is a game that is suitable for players of all ages who enjoy running, jumping and chasing after a raccoon.</p>
