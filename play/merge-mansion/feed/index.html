										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tropical Merge: A Fun and Relaxing Merge Game</h2>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build your tropical paradise</strong>: Tropical Merge features hundreds of tropical objects that you can combine with other items in groups of three or more. Merging these items creates an entirely new object that can be further upgraded by merging it with two others of the same kind. For example, you can merge three coconuts to make a palm tree, then merge three palm trees to make a hut, and so on. Each upgrade becomes more valuable and beautiful as you continue to build your tropical paradise.</li>
<li><strong>Explore and expand to new areas</strong>: As you progress in the game, you can earn amulets and level up to unlock more areas and expand your island. The more areas you open, the more freedom you have to merge and build until you’ve created the perfect utopian island society. There are all kinds of rarities and unlockable items scattered around the map for you to find on your adventure, such as exotic animals, magical gardens, and even dragons.</li>
<li><strong>Complete quests</strong>: Merging and discovering new items is great fun, and many are part of quests that will reward you for building new items. There are so many quests to keep you hooked, and daily quests to keep you coming back for a fresh challenge. You can also earn coins and gems by completing quests, which you can use to buy more items or speed up the merging process.</li>
<li><strong>Play online or offline</strong>: Tropical Merge is a game that you can play anytime and anywhere, whether you have an internet connection or not. You can play on your web browser, Facebook, or mobile device, and your progress will be saved across all platforms. You can also invite your friends to play with you and share your island creations with them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Tropical Merge is a game that is easy to learn but hard to master. The gameplay is simple: you just drag and drop items on the island to merge them with other items of the same kind. You can also tap on an item to move it to an empty space or swap it with another item. The game will give you hints on what items can be merged and what items they will produce.</p>
<p>The game also has some strategic elements that make it more challenging and fun. For example, you have to manage your space wisely, as you can only merge items that are adjacent to each other. You also have to balance your resources, as some items are more rare and valuable than others. You also have to watch out for obstacles, such as rocks or clouds, that may block your merging path.</p>
<p>The game has a relaxing and soothing atmosphere, with colorful graphics, cute animations, and calming music. The game also has a day-night cycle that changes the mood and appearance of your island. You can also customize your island with different themes and decorations that suit your style.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Tropical Merge is a game that will appeal to anyone who loves merging games, farming games, or puzzle games. It is a game that will keep you entertained for hours with its endless possibilities of merging and building. It is also a game that will help you relax and unwind with its tropical vibes and soothing sounds.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a fun and relaxing merge game that will transport you into a fantasy world of adorable animals, magical gardens, and dragons, then Tropical Merge is the game for you.</p>
