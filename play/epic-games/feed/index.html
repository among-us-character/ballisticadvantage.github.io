<h2>Fall Guys Unblocked</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fall Guys : Ultimate Knockout</strong></span> is a platform battle royale game developed by Mediatonic.</p>
<p>The game involves up to 60 players who control jellybean-like creatures and compete against each other in a series of randomly selected mini-games, such as obstacle courses or tag. Players are eliminated as the rounds progress until, eventually, the last remaining player is crowned the winner.</p>
<p>The game was released by Devolver Digital first for PlayStation 4 on 4 August 2020 and after for Microsoft Windows. Following their acquisition of Mediatonic, the publishing rights were transferred to Epic Games. Subsequently, the game was made free-to-play on 21 June 2022, and released on additional platforms including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with full cross-platform play support among all platforms. As part of the transition, the game adapted a seasonal battle pass system for its monetization, offering avatar customizations to players.</p>
<p>Fall Guys received positive reviews from critics for its chaotic gameplay and visual appearance. The game draws inspiration from game shows like Takeshi&#8217;s Castle, It&#8217;s a Knockout, Wipeout, and playground games like tag and British Bulldog. The seventh and current season is Sports and Stadium-themed.</p>
