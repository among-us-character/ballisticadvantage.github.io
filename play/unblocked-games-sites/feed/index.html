<p>Three-card monte, also known as &#8220;find the lady&#8221; or &#8220;three-card trick,&#8221; is a classic confidence game that has been around for centuries. The game involves a dealer who places three cards face down on a table and then quickly moves them around, making it difficult for the player to keep track of which card is which. The player is then asked to bet on which card they think is the &#8220;money card,&#8221; and if they are correct, they win their bet back plus a profit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The game of three-card monte is relatively simple to play</h2>



<p>The dealer will place three cards face down on a table, usually on a cardboard box that provides them with the ability to set up and disappear quickly. Two of the cards will be identical, and the third card will be different. The dealer will then show the player one of the cards and ask them to bet on which card it is.</p>



<p>The dealer will then quickly move the cards around, making it difficult for the player to keep track of which card is which. The player is then given a few seconds to select their card. If the player correctly identifies the card, they win their bet back plus a profit. If they are wrong, they lose their bet.</p>



<p><strong>The Psychology</strong></p>

<li><strong>Fast shuffling:</strong>&nbsp;The dealer shuffles the cards quickly and in a way that makes it difficult for the player to see which card is which.</li>



<li><strong>Distraction:</strong>&nbsp;The dealer may use various distractions,&nbsp;such as talking to the player or other people,&nbsp;to keep the player off balance and make it difficult for them to concentrate.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
