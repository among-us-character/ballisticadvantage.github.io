<p>Dominoes is definitely the most popular puzzle game throughout the globe. It is simple and, at the same time, challenging, which makes it always fun to play, daily and nightly!</p>



<p>Three game modes are designed to provide you with the interactive and interesting gameplays: </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Draw domino: just match a tile in your pile with one of the two ends on the board </li>



<li>Block domino: similar to Draw Dominoes. The only difference is that you pass your turn if you are stuck. </li>



<li>All Five (or Muggins): a bit more sophisticated. </li>



<li>You score points every time you make the number of pips on the ends of the board a multiple of 5.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Domino Gameplay</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Basic Rules:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To form chains of dominoes by matching numbers.</li>



<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Each player receives a set of dominoes. The game starts with a player placing a domino on the table.</li>



<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Players take turns placing dominoes on the ends of the chains, ensuring that the numbers match.</li>



<li><strong>Passing:</strong> If a player cannot play a domino, they must draw one from the stock pile. If they still cannot play, they pass their turn.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Game Modes:</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Draw Domino:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Rules:</strong> Players draw dominoes from the stock pile if they cannot play. The game continues until one player has no dominoes left.</li>



<li><strong>Scoring:</strong> The player who finishes first scores points based on the remaining pips on their opponents&#8217; dominoes.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Block Domino:</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Rules:</strong> Similar to Draw Domino, but if a player cannot play and draws a domino that doesn&#8217;t match, they must pass their turn.</li>



<li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Same as Draw Domino.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>All Five (or Muggins):</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Rules:</strong> In addition to matching numbers, players also score points when the sum of the pips on the open ends of the chains is a multiple of five.</li>



<li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Players score points equal to the multiple of five. For example, if the sum is 15, the player scores 15 points.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">End of the Game:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The game ends when:</li>



<li>One player has no dominoes left.</li>



<li>All players pass their turns consecutively.</li>



<li>The player with the lowest score wins.</li>
</ul>
