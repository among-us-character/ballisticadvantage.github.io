<h2>The best PC simulation games</h2>
<p>What are the best simulation games on PC? From the all-time greats that are still worth playing; the sims with modding communities who breathe eternal life into them; the facsimiles of an aspect of reality so niche you can barely fathom their existence.</p>
</p>
<h2>what is Simulation video game</h2>
<h6>A simulation video game describes a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate real world activities.</h6>
<p>A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training, analysis, prediction, or simply entertainment. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with the player instead allowed to control a character or environment freely. Well-known examples are war games, business games, and role play simulation.</p>
<p>From three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies.</p>
<p>Comparisons of the merits of simulation games versus other teaching techniques have been carried out by many researchers and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published.</p>
<h3>List of Sim video games</h3>
<p>This is a list of Sim games, their expansion packs, and compilations. Most games were developed by Maxis and published either by Maxis (pre-1997 acquisition by Electronic Arts) or by Electronic Arts (post-1997). EA has marketed and recruited companies such as Bullfrog Productions, Firaxis Games, and Tilted Mill Entertainment to develop several games under the Sim brand.</p>
