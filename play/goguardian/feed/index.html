<h3>TUNNEL RUSH Gameplay</h3>
<h4>Interested in high-speed games? Tunnel Rush will bring you all the feelings you desire!</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s a very fast-paced 1st person flying type where you are continuously having to dodge objects which are stationary at first, but soon begin to move as the levels progress. Also, you&#8217;re speed increases with each new level. The only control is by using your thumbs to either dodge left or right to avoid hitting anything. After every 5 crashes, you do have an ad, but only 5 seconds long! And, once you reach level 76, there are no more ads, but that will take you a while. Cool game!</p>
<h5>Introduction to the Tunnel Rush game</h5>
<p>Great game for passing the time. Comparing your app to some similar apps, I love it how we can play inside the tunnel and outside it. It never gets boring. I love how the colors change and how there are both levels and increasing speed. Would be awesome to add some texture colors instead of/plus the solid colored environment. Please add some background sky pictures changeable with the level or every 10 levels. Thank you all.</p>
<p>Really fun game! Reminds me of something that may have been in a video arcade back in the &#8217;80s. Great music; begs to be played with headphones! I think it would be nice to add a few options to settings. I think a control option for rotational speed. Maybe it could have a Bluetooth control setting to use with a gamepad? Even better, up the graphics and being it to the Xbox One! I have seen a lot of Android apps show up in the Xbox Store! Okay, maybe there could be a VR headset option where the screen can be split and put into a Google Cardboard or similar headset, just for more 3D effect. Okay, I&#8217;ll stop there, since this is supposed to be a short review. In summary, Great Job Guys!. Oh, I almost forgot, please add a pro option to buy it and remove ads and make the game continuable without any ad watching!</p>
