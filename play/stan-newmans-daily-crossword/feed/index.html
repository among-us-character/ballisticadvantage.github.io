<p>Word Wipe is a fast-paced word puzzle game where players race against the clock to find and clear words from a board of letters. The game is easy to learn but challenging to master, and it&#8217;s a great way to improve your vocabulary and word recognition skills.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>



<p>The goal of Word Wipe is to clear as many words from the board as possible before the time runs out. Players can clear words by dragging their finger or mouse over the letters to form words. Words can be formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>



<p>Once a word is formed, it disappears from the board and new letters fall down to fill the empty spaces. If a player can clear enough words, they will progress to the next level.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips and Strategies</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some tips and strategies for playing Word Wipe:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Look for long words: Long words are worth more points, so it&#8217;s worth taking the time to find them.</li>



<li>Use all of the letters: Don&#8217;t just focus on the letters in the middle of the board. Try to use all of the letters to form as many words as possible.</li>



<li>Think outside the box: Don&#8217;t be afraid to think outside the box and look for obscure words.</li>



<li>Use the power-ups: The power-ups can help you to clear words more quickly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
