<h2>Talking Ben the Dog Free</h2>
<h6>Have fun with Ben, Talking Tom&#8217;s best friend</h6>
<p><strong>Talking Ben the Dog Free</strong> is a fun application from the creators of My <strong>Talking Tom</strong>, where you have to take care of a dog and have phone conversations with him. He&#8217;ll also show you fun chemistry experiments.</p>
<p>To talk with him, just get his attention by touching his legs or the newspaper he&#8217;s always reading.</p>
</p>
<h3>Talking Ben original song</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Talking Ben</strong></span> is currently a bigger deal than we ever thought he would be. So I made a song.</p>
</p>
<h2>How do you play Talking Ben</h2>
<p><strong> Talking Ben the Dog</strong> is an interaction-based video game released on April 29, 2011 by Outfit7. It is the second game in the Talking Tom &amp; Friends Franchise and is preceded by Talking Tom Cat and succeeded by <strong>Talking Tom 2</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from the basic features like swiping and tapping Ben for a reaction, recording videos, and making him repeat what you say like in most Talking Friends games, you are able to do a variety of things such as.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking to Ben on the telephone.</li>
<li>Feeding him a can of beans.</li>
<li>Giving him a drink.</li>
<li>Making him burp.</li>
<li>Making Ben read a newspaper, causing him fall asleep while</li>
<li>reading it.</li>
<li>Going to Ben’s lab and mixing chemicals on a table to get different outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In early 2022, a popular YouTuber and streamer named &#8220;IShowSpeed&#8221; played this game, becoming a famous meme on the internet due to his overwhelming and funny rivalry with <strong>Talking Ben</strong>.</p>
<p>The meme mostly shows IShowSpeed asking Ben controversial questions on a telephone such as, if he loves God, if he supports LGBTQ, does he support Black Lives Matter, etc. He somewhat argues and yells at him aggressively whenever he replied a negative response. Ben and his app became the first popular meme to be from Outfit7.</p>
</p>
<h3>How do you get talking Ben to talk?</h3>
<p>Ben is a retired chemistry professor who likes his quiet comfortable life of eating, drinking and reading newspapers. To make him responsive, you will have to bother him long enough that he will fold his newspaper. Then you can talk to him, poke or tickle him or even have a telephone conversation with him.</p>
<p>If you get <strong>Ben</strong> to his laboratory however, he becomes as happy as a puppy. There you can do chemistry experiments by mixing a combination of two test tubes together and see the hilarious reactions.</p>
<h2>HOW TO PLAY Talking Ben the Dog</h2>
<ul>
<li>&#8211; Poke Ben&#8217;s newspaper to make him fold it.</li>
<li>&#8211; Then you can talk to Ben and he will repeat.</li>
<li>&#8211; Poke or slap Ben&#8217;s face, belly, feet or hands.</li>

<li>&#8211; Record a funny video of your telephone conversation with Ben.</li>
<li>&#8211; Press buttons to make Ben eat, drink or belch.</li>
<li>&#8211; Press the chemistry button to switch Ben to the laboratory.</li>
<li>&#8211; Mix any two test tubes together and see the hilarious chemical reaction.</li>
<li>&#8211; Record videos and share them on YouTube or send them to your friends and family by email.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talking Ben</h3>
<p>I’m Ben. I’m a genius. Blunt, yes, but true! I do have hidden depths though. I’m a very funny guy, for example. Although, to be fair, I haven’t actually received external confirmation of that yet… So it’s just a hypothesis at the moment. But still! Funny AND smart.</p>
<p>My inventions are going to put our app studio on the map! Well, the ones that don’t explode that is… But that only happened once… (Or twice.) Inventing is easy as pie for me. It’s as easy as breathing. What’s hard is getting Tom to clean up after himself. Or say thank you every now and again! I’m working on it though. It’s my greatest challenge yet!</p>
</p>
<h2>Talking Ben: Pet Time</h2>
<p>You will have to move with cunning and strategy so that you can succeed in this game to meet Ben&#8217; s needs. Help Ben with his food, with his drink, caress him, touch his legs, belly, head and have fun. Test your arrow level skills and try to set a new record. Have fun in this game for the little ones in the house. Let&#8217; s have a fun time taking care of Ben. This fun game can be done from any device: Smartphone, Tablet and PC.</p>
