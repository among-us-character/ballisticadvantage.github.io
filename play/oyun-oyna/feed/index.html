<p>The player can move in any direction and can jump to overcome obstacles. In the start, the game begins with less difficulty, but as the player learn how to play the game, the difficulty increases and the player finds the game bit challenging. After completing two levels, the box appears who fall upon coming in contact with the player or as the player crosses them.</p>
<p>The player aims to make points and complete as many levels as possible to become the master.</p>
<p>The color of the tunnel will be changed as the player moves to the next level. The player controls his character from a third-person viewpoint, and he doesn’t need to control the speed, he has to control the direction of the character to advance.</p>

<h3>Why is school Coolmath Games blocked?</h3>
<p>According to Cool Math Games’ shut down is a hoax: “Since the site’s opening in 1997, Cool Math Games has been an escape for students during stressful, boring school days.” … This will then cause merely every game on the site to no longer be accessible(to people who still use Flash).</p>

<h4>Run 3, known simply as &#8220;Run&#8221; for Android and more excitedly as &#8220;Run!!!&#8221; for iOS, is the third game of the Run trilogy.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It originally released to Google Play on December 11th, 2013. It would later come to Kongregate as a Flash game on June 5th, 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On release it was little more than a remake of the original Run. Through a stream of consistent updates throughout the years, however, the title has evolved a distinct entry into the series with a plethora of unique gimmicks, characters, and an overarching plot.</p>
<h3>run 3 Gameplay</h3>
<p>The game better resembles Run 1 with levels that take on the form of tunnels and are (mostly) comprised of tiles. Returning from Run 2, however, is a selection of unique characters to play as and various types of platforms that behave differently when stepped on.</p>
<h3>Is run 2 playable?</h3>
<h6>Run 2 is the second installment in the Run series.</h6>
<p>It was published on March 21, 2011, by Player_03, but is no longer being updated. Run 2 is non-canon; it does not have a storyline or fit into the story of Run 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player_03 has confirmed that Run 2 and Run 1 will be converted to Runaway3D after Run 3 is on most websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Run 2, you play as a gray alien running through a series of different levels. You must run across platforms while avoiding obstacles and gaps in the floor. If you fall off the stage, the level will reset and you will have to start again. You must take advantage of the unique gravity system, with some levels requiring the player to jump onto sideways facing blocks or even blocks above them to progress to the next level.</p>
<p>When a wall or ceiling is touched, the character will &#8220;catch&#8221; onto the new surface and the gravity of the level will flip and the character will run on the new surface as though it were the floor. It is necessary to use this unique gameplay mechanic to complete many levels. However, some narrow, dark surfaces cannot be caught onto.</p>

<p>Ballistic is a free online game developed by Arkadium. It is a puzzle game where you have to launch balls at targets to destroy them. The game has over 100 levels, and each level gets progressively more difficult.</p>



<p>To play Ballistic, you use the mouse to aim and launch the balls. You can also use the keyboard to control the game. The left and right arrow keys move the cannon, and the space bar launches the ball.</p>



<p>The goal of the game is to destroy all of the targets on the screen. You can do this by launching balls at them directly, or by ricocheting the balls off of other objects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform:capitalize">How to play Ballistic</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start by aiming the cannon at the targets. You can do this by moving the mouse or using the left and right arrow keys.</li>



<li>Once you have aimed the cannon, click the mouse or press the space bar to launch the ball.</li>



<li>The ball will bounce off of walls and other objects. Use this to your advantage to ricochet the ball into the targets.</li>



<li>Destroy all of the targets on the screen to complete the level.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform:capitalize">tips for playing:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use the ricochet mechanic to your advantage. You can often destroy multiple targets with a single ball by ricocheting it off of walls and other objects.</li>



<li>Be careful not to launch the ball too hard. If you launch the ball too hard, it will bounce off of the walls and fly off the screen.</li>



<li>Use the power-ups to your advantage. Power-ups can help you to destroy targets more easily or to reach difficult areas.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ballistic is a fun and challenging puzzle game that is suitable for all ages. It is a great way to pass the time or to improve your problem-solving skills.</p>
