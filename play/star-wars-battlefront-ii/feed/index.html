<h3>The best Star Wars games on PC 2022</h3>
<p>What are the best Star Wars games for PC? It’s not like we Star Wars fans need much of an excuse to jump back into a galaxy far, far away – May 4, the KOTOR remake, a new episode of Book of Boba Fett. Something Star Wars related happens, and suddenly we’re all off swinging our lightsabers and asking people to refrain from telling us the odds, thank you very much.</p>
<h3>Star Wars games PC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</li>
<li>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords</li>
<li>Star Wars: Republic Commando</li>

</ul>
<h4>LEGO STAR WARS: THE COMPLETE SAGA</h4>
<p>The original Traveller’s Tales Lego game, Lego Star Wars is proof that a great idea can live forever. The Complete Saga covers episodes I to VI, recreates the adventures of all key characters in blocky form, and asks you to break everything in your path on your journey towards defeating the Empire.</p>
<p>Best played as a local co-op game, its gentle puzzles and good-natured humour makes it a strong pick to play with your smaller family members. If you don’t hoard it for yourself, that is. And, thanks to the custom character creator, you can make Boba Fett a Sith Lord.</p>
</p>
<h2>Star Wars Unblocked Games</h2>
<p>A New Hope introduces us to the main trio of heroes, starting off with Luke Skywalker, who will end up becoming the world’s greatest Jedi who defeats Darth Vader, a powerful Sith Lord, who are the enemies of the Jedi, with the first ones wielding the Light Side of the Force, while the Sith use the Dark Side of the Force. This goal and the saving of the galaxy from the evil Empire with their Stormtroopers enforcing their rules is done through two more movies, called The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.</p>

<h3>What are Star Wars Games?</h3>
<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far away&#8230; this is already one of the most iconic phrases in cinema and pop culture in general since they were the first words seen on-screen at the 1977 premiere of the first Star Wars movie, after which followed decades of amazing movies, television series, both live-action and animated, amazing toys, pop-culture references, video games, online gaming experiences, and many more things, as this franchise has only expanded and risen in popularity, gaining new fans and bringing back old ones one piece of content at a time!</p>
