<p>1010! Block Puzzle Game is a simple yet addictive puzzle game developed by Gram Games. It was released in 2014 and has since become one of the most popular puzzle games on mobile devices.</p>



<p>The game is played on a 10&#215;10 grid, and players must place blocks on the grid and group them together to clear rows and columns. When a row or column is completed, it disappears and the player earns points. The more blocks that are grouped together, the more points the player earns. The game ends when the player runs out of blocks or when they can no longer place any more blocks on the board.</p>
