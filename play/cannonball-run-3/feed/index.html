In the start, the game begins with less difficulty, but as the player learn how to play the game, the difficulty increases and the player finds the game bit challenging. After completing two levels, the box appears who fall upon coming in contact with the player or as the player crosses them.</p>
<p>The player aims to make points and complete as many levels as possible to become the master.</p>
<p>The color of the tunnel will be changed as the player moves to the next level. The player controls his character from a third-person viewpoint, and he doesn’t need to control the speed, he has to control the direction of the character to advance.</p>

<h4>Run 3, known simply as &#8220;Run&#8221; for Android and more excitedly as &#8220;Run!!!&#8221; for iOS, is the third game of the Run trilogy.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It originally released to Google Play on December 11th, 2013. It would later come to Kongregate as a Flash game on June 5th, 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On release it was little more than a remake of the original Run. Through a stream of consistent updates throughout the years, however, the title has evolved a distinct entry into the series with a plethora of unique gimmicks, characters, and an overarching plot.</p>
<h3>run 3 Gameplay</h3>
<p>The game better resembles Run 1 with levels that take on the form of tunnels and are (mostly) comprised of tiles. Returning from Run 2, however, is a selection of unique characters to play as and various types of platforms that behave differently when stepped on.</p>
<h3>Is run 2 playable?</h3>
<h6>Run 2 is the second installment in the Run series.</h6>
<p>It was published on March 21, 2011, by Player_03, but is no longer being updated. Run 2 is non-canon; it does not have a storyline or fit into the story of Run 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player_03 has confirmed that Run 2 and Run 1 will be converted to Runaway3D after Run 3 is on most websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Run 2, you play as a gray alien running through a series of different levels. You must run across platforms while avoiding obstacles and gaps in the floor. If you fall off the stage, the level will reset and you will have to start again. You must take advantage of the unique gravity system, with some levels requiring the player to jump onto sideways facing blocks or even blocks above them to progress to the next level.</p>
<p>When a wall or ceiling is touched, the character will &#8220;catch&#8221; onto the new surface and the gravity of the level will flip and the character will run on the new surface as though it were the floor. It is necessary to use this unique gameplay mechanic to complete many levels. However, some narrow, dark surfaces cannot be caught onto.</p>
