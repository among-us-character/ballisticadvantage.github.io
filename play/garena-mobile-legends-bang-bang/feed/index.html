<p class="has-medium-font-size">Power-Ups and Boosters</p>



<p>Throughout the game, you&#8217;ll encounter various power-ups and boosters that can help you complete levels more efficiently. These can include explosives, lightning strikes, and more. Strategically using these tools can be the key to achieving high scores and overcoming difficult challenges.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Challenging Levels</p>



<p>Jewels Blitz presents a wide range of levels, each with its own set of objectives and difficulties. As you progress, you&#8217;ll encounter obstacles, limited moves, time constraints, and more.
