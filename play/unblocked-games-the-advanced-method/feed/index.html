<p>Happy Room is a physics-based puzzle game that revolves around torturing a hapless dummy in increasingly creative ways. The game is deceptively simple, but it offers a surprising amount of depth and challenge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>



<p>The goal of Happy Room is to use a variety of weapons and traps to kill the dummy in as many different ways as possible. The game is split into two main modes: Campaign and Sandbox.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Campaign Mode</strong></h2>



<p>Campaign mode presents a series of challenges that gradually increase in difficulty. Each challenge has a specific goal, such as killing the dummy with a certain weapon or in a certain way. Completing challenges earns you money, which can be used to unlock new weapons, traps, and decorations for your room.</p>



<p>Campaign mode is a great way to learn the ropes of the game and to experience the wide variety of challenges that Happy Room has to offer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sandbox Mode</strong></h2>



<p>Sandbox mode gives you complete freedom to build your own rooms and experiment with different ways to kill the dummy. You can place any of the weapons, traps, and decorations that you have unlocked, and you can even create your own physics objects from scratch.</p>



<p>Sandbox mode is a great way to let your creativity run wild and to create some truly outlandish and hilarious kill rooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>



<p>Happy Room features a wide variety of weapons, each with its own unique properties. Some weapons are designed for quick and efficient kills, while others are more for inflicting maximum pain and suffering.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the weapons available in Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lasers:</strong> These can be used to cut the dummy in half or to disintegrate it entirely.</li>



<li><strong>Explosives:</strong> These can be used to blow the dummy up in a variety of spectacular ways.</li>



<li><strong>Traps:</strong> These can be used to catch the dummy off guard and inflict damage in unexpected ways.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Traps</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to weapons, Happy Room also features a variety of traps that can be used to kill the dummy. Traps can be triggered by the dummy&#8217;s movement, or they can be set off manually.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the traps available in Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Spikes:</strong> These can impale the dummy if it touches them.</li>



<li><strong>Pitfalls:</strong> These can drop the dummy into a deadly abyss. </li>



<li><strong>Grinders:</strong> These can slowly grind the dummy to pieces.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Decorations</strong></p>



<p>In addition to weapons and traps, Happy Room also features a variety of decorations that can be used to customize your room. Decorations can be purely aesthetic, or they can have a gameplay impact, such as slowing down the dummy&#8217;s movement or increasing the damage of weapons.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the decorations available in Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Candles:</strong> These can be used to create a spooky atmosphere.</li>



<li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> These can block the dummy&#8217;s path and force it to take different routes.</li>



<li><strong>Power-ups:</strong> These can temporarily give the dummy enhanced abilities, such as increased speed or invulnerability.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>



<p>Happy Room is a fun and addictive game that offers a surprising amount of depth and challenge. The physics-based gameplay is unique and satisfying, and the wide variety of weapons, traps, decorations, and challenges ensures that there is always something new to discover.</p>



<p>I highly recommend Happy Room to anyone who enjoys physics-based puzzles, creative problem-solving, or just plain old mayhem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guide to Play</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few tips for playing Happy Room:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Experiment with different weapons and traps:</strong> There&#8217;s no right or wrong way to kill the dummy, so experiment with different combinations of weapons and traps to see what works best.</li>



<li><strong>Be creative:</strong> There are no limits to what you can do in Happy Room, so let your imagination run wild.</li>



<li><strong>Have fun:</strong> Happy Room is a game designed to be enjoyed, so relax and have some fun with it.</li>
