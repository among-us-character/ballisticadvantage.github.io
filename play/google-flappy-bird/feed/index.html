<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Play Flappy Bird Online for Free</h2>


<p>Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Vietnamese</a> <strong>video game</strong> artist and programmer Dong Nguyen, under his game development company Gears.</p>
<h2>Flappy Bird game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird</h2>
<p>attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. Nguyen created the <a href="https://www.virlan.co/unblocked-games/">game</a> over the period of several days, using a bird protagonist that he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Flappy Bird Gameplay</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Flappy Bird World Record and High Score 999!</h2>


<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flappy Bird unblocked</span> is a one-eyed pixel fish with wings flapping its way through an endless slalom of Super Mario pipes.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t a Miyamoto fever-dream, it&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flappy Bird</span>, and it has come to consume your very soul. Or, you know, make you tap your mobile device of choice a bunch for two minutes before deleting it. It certainly scratches the itch for exacting, skill-based achievement thoroughly, but its staggering lack of ambition or creativity put a pretty low ceiling on how high it can soar.</p>
<p>Flappy Bird was released in May 2013 but received a sudden spike in popularity in early 2014 and became a sleeper hit.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flappy Bird io</span> received poor reviews from some critics, who criticized its high level of difficulty and alleged plagiarism in graphics and game mechanics, while other reviewers found it addictive. At the end of January 2014, it was the most downloaded free game in the App Store for iOS. During this period, its developer said that Flappy Bird was earning $50,000 a day from in-app advertisements as well as sales.</p>
<h3>What happened to flappy bird</h3>
<p>Flappy Bird was removed from both the App Store and Google Play on February 10, 2014, with Nguyen claiming that he felt guilty over what he considered to be the game&#8217;s addictive nature and overusage. Its popularity and sudden removal caused phones with the game installed before its removal to be put up for sale for high prices over the Internet.</p>
<h3>Flappy Bird APK</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Games similar to Flappy Bird became popular on the iOS App Store in the wake of its removal, and both Apple and Google have removed games from their app stores for being too similar to the original game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August 2014, a revised version of Flappy Bird, called Flappy Birds Family, was released exclusively for the Amazon Fire TV. Bay Tek Games also released a licensed coin-operated Flappy Bird arcade game.</p>
<p>Flappy Bird has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/08/flappy-bird-creator-to-take-game-down-tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken down</a> from both the Apple App Store and the Google Play store.</p>
