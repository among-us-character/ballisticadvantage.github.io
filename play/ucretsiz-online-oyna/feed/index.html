										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Among Us: A Game of Teamwork and Betrayal in Space</h2>
<p>Among Us is a multiplayer game that challenges players to work together and find the impostor among them.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The game can be played online or over local WiFi with 4 to 15 players. One to three players are randomly assigned the role of impostors, while the rest are crewmates. The crewmates have to complete tasks around a spaceship, a base, or a planet, while the impostors have to sabotage and kill them without being caught.</p>
<p>The crewmates can win by completing all their tasks or by voting out all the impostors in emergency meetings or dead body reports. The impostors can win by killing enough crewmates, by sabotaging a critical system and letting the countdown run out, or by convincing the crewmates to vote out one of their own.</p>
<p>The game has various settings that can be customized by the host, such as the number of impostors, the map, the task list, the player speed, the vision range, the kill cooldown, and more. The game also has optional roles that can create more chaos and fun, such as the Scientist, the Engineer, the Guardian Angel, or the Shapeshifter.</p>
<h2>Why It’s Fun</h2>

The game is full of suspense, humor, and drama, as you try to figure out who is trustworthy and who is not. The game also encourages communication and teamwork among the crewmates, as they have to work together to fix sabotages and find clues.</p>
<p>The game is also very accessible and easy to play, as it supports cross-platform play between Android, iOS, PC, and console devices. You can play with your friends or join random lobbies online. You can also customize your character’s appearance with different colors, outfits, hats, and pets.</p>
