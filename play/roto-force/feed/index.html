<li><strong>Use the terrain to your advantage.</strong> The tracks in Monster Truck Stunt Racing are full of hills, ramps, and other obstacles. Use these obstacles to perform stunts and gain speed.</li>



<li><strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to use the handbrake.</strong> The handbrake is a powerful tool that can be used to save yourself from a crash or to perform a stunt.</li>



<li><strong>Upgrade your truck as you progress.</strong> Upgrading your truck will give you a better chance of winning races and performing stunts.</li>



<li><strong>Join a multiplayer game and compete against other players.</strong> Multiplayer is a great way to test your skills against other players and earn even more rewards.</li>
