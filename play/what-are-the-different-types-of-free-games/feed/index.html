<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Play Free Sudoku online : one of the most popular puzzle games</h2>


<h2>Sudoku Easy</h2>
<p><strong>Sudoku for all players : from beginners to advanced players.</strong></p>
<p>If you like easy <strong>sudoku</strong> where you can have fun, enjoy, relax and pass your free time in a pleasant way you will love this game.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Hard</h2>
<p>If you like to raise big sudoku challenges and make your brain work hard, this classic sudoku game is also perfect for you.</p>
</p>
<h2>How to Play Sudoku</h2>
<h2>Sudoku rules</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sudoku</strong></span> is a lo`gic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classic Sudoku</a>, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.</p>
<h2>What are the 3 rules of Sudoku?</h2>
<p>Sudoku rules are simple and straightforward. It is precisely their simplicity that makes finding the solution and solving these puzzles a true challenge.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 1: Use Numbers 1-9</h2>
<p>Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces).<br />Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated?</p>
<p>As you can see from the image below of an actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the easier the game – the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 2: Don’t Repeat Any Numbers</h2>
<p>As you can see, in the upper left square (circled in blue), this square already has 7 out of the 9 spaces filled in. The only numbers missing from the square are 5 and 6. By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 3 : The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)</h2>
<p>A regular 9 x 9 grid is divided into 9 smaller blocks of 3 x 3, also known as nonets. The numbers from 1 to 9 can only occur once per nonet.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that the process of filling the rows and columns without duplicated digits finds inside each block another restriction to the numbers’ positioning.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 4 : The sum of every single row, column and nonet must equal 45</h2>
<p>To find out which numbers are missing from each row, column or block or if there are any duplicates, the player can simply count or flex their math skills and sum the numbers. When the digits occur only once, the total of each row, column and group must be of 45.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
<p><strong>What is Sudoku solving algorithms?</strong></p>
<p>A standard Sudoku contains 81 cells, in a 9×9 grid, and has 9 boxes, each box being the intersection of the first, middle, or last 3 rows, and the first, middle, or last 3 columns.</p>
<p>Each cell may contain a number from one to nine, and each number can only occur once in each row, column, and box. A Sudoku starts with some cells containing numbers (clues), and the goal is to solve the remaining cells. Proper Sudokus have one solution. Players and investigators use a wide range of computer algorithms to solve Sudokus, study their properties, and make new puzzles, including Sudokus with interesting symmetries and other properties.</p>
<p>There are several computer algorithms that will solve 9×9 puzzles (n=9) in fractions of a second, but combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed, analyzed, and solved as n increases.</p>

<h3>What is Killer Sudoku?</h3>
<p>Killer Sudoku is a fun twist on the classic sudoku for those of you seeking something new and challenging. It’s also known by such names as sumdoku, addoku and sumoku puzzle but in a nutshell it’s pretty much the same number puzzle.</p>
<h4>What’s the difference between Sudoku and Killer Sudoku?</h4>
<p>Although both number puzzles share a lot of similarities, there’s also a major difference – amount of arithmetics involved.</p>
<p>In Killer Sudoku there’s a new concept of a “cage” – a group of cells within a dotted line that make up a sum shown as a small number above. Like in Sudoku, your ultimate goal is to fill the grid with numbers, while paying attention to ”the sum rule”.</p>
</p>
<h3>What is Sudoku Evil?</h3>
<p>Sudoku evil is a 9×9 grid sudoku puzzle with the highest possible level of difficulty. It’s an advanced level only for experienced sudoku solvers. Simple logic and basic knowledge of sudoku rules won’t cut it – you as a player should know advanced sudoku solving techniques and understand how to apply them in practice.</p>
<p>Even though evil sudoku is an extremely difficult game level, many experienced players find it the best way for brain training and developing mental skills.</p>
<h4>How to solve Sudoku Evil?</h4>
<p>The principle of the solution is the same as in the classic Sudoku. The goal is to fill the grid, so that each row, column, and 3&#215;3 block contain all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating. But in Evil Sudoku, there are much fewer numbers on the grid at the beginning. There&#8217;s going to be only 4 or even fewer numbers. This fact makes the evil sudoku level extremely difficult to solve.</p>
<p>The best way to solve the evil sudoku puzzle is to start with the blocks where there are more prearranged numbers. Such blocks are easier to complete compared to the ones with fewer numbers.</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1659794323544"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Is Sudoku good for your brain?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Taking a stab at Sudoku is another working-memory training activity. It&#8217;s like chess — while you&#8217;re making a move, you have to think three or four steps ahead to your next move. And that&#8217;s good exercise for the brain.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1659794337378"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Which level of Sudoku is the hardest?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">This hardest Sudoku puzzle is characterized by the fact that only a few numbers are shown in the Sudoku square, which consists of 9 small squares, where the cells are located 3&#215;3.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1659794346659"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the secret to doing Sudoku puzzles?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The easiest way starting a Sudoku puzzle is to scan rows and columns within each triple-box area, eliminating numbers or squares and finding situations where only a single number can fit into a single square. The scanning technique is fast and usually sufficient to solve easy puzzles all the way to the end.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1659794356652"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What happens if you play Sudoku everyday?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The more you play, the better you become. If you play Sudoku daily, you will start to discover that you have almost a sort of “sense memory” for the puzzle grid – you will start to see patterns emerging and develop the ability to seize opportunities more quickly.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1659794604547"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Which Sudoku game is best?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Andoku Sudoku 3 is the best offline sudoku app for Android users and the reason some refer to it as the best sudoku app overall. This app has more than 20,000 puzzles with six variations of sudoku and eight levels of difficulty. There are also autosave features, automatic error checking, and pencil mark compatibility.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1659794624606"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can Sudoku increase IQ?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Practising a game like sudoku or using a brain training app might make you better at it but it won&#8217;t boost your IQ or general brain power, a study claims. And instead, researchers suggest people exercise more, socialise and make sure they get enough sleep if they want their mind to be sharper.</p> </div> </div>
