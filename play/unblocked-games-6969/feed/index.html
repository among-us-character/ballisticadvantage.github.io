<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Basketball Stars : Multiplayer</h2>


<p>Parents need to know that Basketball Stars simulates two kinds of competitions: a shooting race and a one-on-one game. Games cost in-game currency or real money to enter (against a real, online opponent), and then the winner gets the prize money with which you can buy stuff like shirts, hats, sunglasses, headphones, or new basketballs to customize your player.</p>
<p>The first play mode <em>Basketball Stars</em> introduces is called Shooting Race, a timed competition to see who can make more buckets. Shooting requires a swipe of just the right length for your current distance from the hoop, as judged by a meter on the left side of the screen. Swipe too hard and you’ll shoot hard off the backboard, too soft and the shot will fall short.</p>
