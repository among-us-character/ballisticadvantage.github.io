<h3>Escape room</h3>
<p>An escape room, also known as an <strong>escape game</strong>, puzzle room, or exit game, is a game in which a team of players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal in a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>The goal is often to escape from the site of the game. Most escape games are cooperative but competitive variants exist.</p>
<p>Escape rooms became popular in North America, Europe, and East Asia in the 2010s. Permanent escape rooms in fixed locations were first opened in Asia and followed later in Hungary, Serbia, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, and South America.</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1658329612258"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How do you play the game maze?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Students take turns according to their number and they each get a chance to guess where the path is. When it is their turn, they will step into the maze at the start and begin to choose an adjacent square – either forward, to the side or diagonal to the one they are standing on.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1658329622455"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Why is it called a maze?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The word “maze” dates from the 13th century and comes from the Middle English word mæs, denoting delirium or delusion. The word “labyrinth” may date as far back as the 14th century, and derives from the Latin labyrinthus and the Greek labýrinthos, or, a building with intricate passages.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1658329630039"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the goal of a maze?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Mazes have essentially five possible purposes: to escape, to get the prize, to trace a path, to be a metaphor, to be a stage. Escape: By far the most common purpose of a maze is to challenge the visitor to find the means of passing through and escaping. This is true of pencil and paper mazes and most hedge mazes.</p> </div> </div>
