<p>Crystal Connect, by Azerion Casual Games, invites you on a dazzling adventure to collect precious crystals. This guide will equip you with the knowledge to navigate through challenging levels and become a master gem connector!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Quest: Clearing the Crystal Grid</strong></h2>



<p>Your objective is to remove all the crystals from the board. Here&#8217;s how you achieve this:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Matching Mania:</strong> Find pairs of identical crystals and connect them with a line.</li>



<li><strong>Bend, but Don&#8217;t Break the Rule:</strong> The connecting line can only change direction twice (make two 90-degree turns) at most. It cannot pass through other crystals on its path.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mastering the Match:</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Planning Makes Perfect:</strong> Scan the board for potential matches before making a move. Look for crystals that are close together or connected by a path with at most two bends.</li>



<li><strong>Think Ahead:</strong> Consider the impact of your move on future connections. Clearing one crystal might open up new possibilities for others.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overcoming Obstacles:</strong></h2>



<p>As you progress, you&#8217;ll encounter challenges on the board:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Shrubs:</strong> These leafy patches hide additional crystals. Match crystals next to them to reveal the hidden gems.</li>



<li><strong>Stone Slabs:</strong> These immovable obstacles add another layer of complexity to your path. Plan your connections carefully to navigate around them.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bonus Boosters:</strong></h2>



<p>Keep an eye out for special items that can give you an edge:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hints:</strong> Stuck? Use a hint to get a nudge in the right direction.</li>



<li><strong>Shuffles:</strong> Can&#8217;t find a match? A shuffle refreshes the board layout, potentially revealing new connections.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips for Triumph:</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prioritize Special Gems:</strong> Look for and connect explosive gems to clear a larger area and create chain reactions.</li>



<li><strong>Work from the Bottom Up:</strong> Clearing the bottom rows first can create more opportunities for matches above.</li>



<li><strong>Think Outside the Square:</strong> Don&#8217;t get fixated on horizontal and vertical lines. Utilize the two-bend rule to explore diagonal connections.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Embrace the Challenge:</strong></h2>



<p>Crystal Connect offers a delightful blend of casual fun and strategic thinking. With practice, you&#8217;ll develop your gem-matching skills and conquer even the most challenging levels. So, dive into the world of Crystal Connect and embark on your sparkling quest today!</p>

<h2>Pac-Man is a Japanese video game franchise</h2>
<p>created by Toru Iwatani but published, developed and owned by Bandai Namco Entertainment (formerly Namco).</p>
<p>Entries have been developed by a wide array of other video game companies, including Midway Games, Atari and Mass Media, Inc. The eponymous first entry was released in arcades in 1980 by Namco, and published by Midway Games in North America.</p>
<ul>
<li>he game is considered to be the first Pac-Man game made with HTML5.</li>
<li>The game is internally referred to as just &#8220;30th Anniversary of PAC-MAN&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Most Pac-Man games are maze chase games</h2>
<p>however it has also delved into other genres, such as platformers, racing, and sports. Several games in the series have been released for a multitude of home consoles and are included in many Namco video game compilations.</p>
<h2>Pac-Man Google Doodle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pac-Man Google Doodle is a playable HTML5 game, created by Marcin Wichary on May 21, 2010 to celebrate Pac-Man&#8217;s 30th anniversary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logo was originally featured on the Google homepage, before being removed after 48 hours; it is still accessible online by Google searching for the term &#8220;Pac-Man&#8221;. <br />The gameplay is very similar to the original game, with similar Ghost A.I. The main difference is the shape of the maze, which is now shaped around the Google logo. There is also a two-player co-op mode with Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, which can be accessed by clicking &#8220;Insert Coin&#8221; after the game has already begun; the description said that it was &#8220;a little easter egg&#8221;. <br />The infamous 256th level was also featured in the game (after completing all 255 levels). Completing it results in a &#8220;Game Over&#8221; screen.</p>
<h3>Pac-Man is one of the longest-running, best-selling, and highest-grossing video game franchises in history</h3>
<p>it has seen regular releases for over 40 years, has sold nearly 48 million copies across all platforms, and has grossed over US$14.107 billion, most of which has been from the original arcade game.</p>
<p>The character of <strong>Pac-Man</strong> is the official mascot of Bandai Namco, and remains one of the most recognizable video game characters in history. The franchise is seen as important and influential, and is often used as a representation for 1980s popular culture and video games as a whole.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mahjongg Dimensions Candy: 640 Second Challenge</h2>



<p>Get ready to tantalize your taste buds and challenge your mind with Mahjongg Dimensions Candy 640 Seconds! This game combines the classic tile-matching fun of Mahjongg with a delicious candy theme and a thrilling time limit. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s your guide to conquering this sugary challenge:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Sweet Basics</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Just like regular Mahjongg, your goal is to eliminate all the tiles from the board. You can only remove tiles that are identical and have at least one open side (not blocked by other tiles).</li>



<li><strong>Candy Crush:</strong> This version features delectable candy-themed tiles instead of the usual Mahjongg symbols.</li>



<li><strong>The Clock is Ticking:</strong> The twist? You only have 640 seconds (10 minutes and 40 seconds) to complete the board. That means quick thinking and strategic tile selection are crucial!</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips for Time Travelers</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sharpen Your Vision:</strong> Quickly scan the board to identify matching candy tiles. Look for ones with open sides that you can readily remove.</li>



<li><strong>Think in 3D:</strong> This version adds a new dimension! The board is 3D, so rotate it using your mouse or keyboard arrows to find hidden matching pairs behind or underneath other tiles.</li>



<li><strong>Prioritize Special Tiles:</strong> Keep an eye out for special candy tiles that might offer unique abilities to help you clear the board faster.</li>



<li><strong>Plan Your Moves:</strong> Don&#8217;t just remove random tiles. Try to anticipate future matches and remove tiles that will open up more options for later moves.</li>



<li><strong>Work Quickly, But Stay Calm:</strong> With the time limit looming, it&#8217;s easy to get flustered. Take a deep breath, focus on the board, and make calculated moves to maximize your efficiency.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> If you get stuck, some versions of the game might offer a hint button. Use it sparingly, as it can disrupt your focus and waste precious seconds.</p>



<p>With a dash of focus, a sprinkle of strategy, and a whole lot of candy-fueled fun, you&#8217;ll be a Mahjongg Dimensions Candy master in no time! So go forth, conquer the sugary board, and beat the clock!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Venge.io : Play Online Multiplayer First-Person Shooter Game</h2>



<p>Venge.io is a free-to-play, browser-based action game that throws you into a chaotic arena of sword-wielding maniacs. It&#8217;s a frantic mix of fast-paced combat, strategic power-ups, and character progression, perfect for short bursts of adrenaline-fueled action.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Venge.io Review</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Thrilling Gameplay:</strong> Venge.io is pure pick-up-and-play fun. The controls are simple to learn, but mastering the art of dodging, attacking, and using power-ups effectively takes practice. The constant brawling keeps the action fresh and exciting.</li>



<li><strong>Strategic Depth:</strong> While the core gameplay is easy to grasp, there&#8217;s more to Venge.io than just swinging your sword wildly. Choosing the right power-ups at the right moment and learning to predict opponent movement can mean the difference between victory and defeat. </li>



<li> <strong>Progression System:</strong> The game offers a sense of progression as you level up and unlock new character skins and weapons. While it doesn&#8217;t drastically change the gameplay, it adds a bit of customization and keeps players engaged. </li>



<li> <strong>Limited Depth:</strong> Despite its strategic elements, Venge.io is ultimately a casual experience. Matches are quick, and there&#8217;s no complex story or deep character customization. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to play Venge.io</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li> <strong>The Basics:</strong> Use WASD to move and your mouse to aim and attack. Left click to slash, and right click to throw your weapon (which can be retrieved). </li>



<li> <strong>Power-ups:</strong> Keep an eye out for glowing orbs that appear throughout the arena. These grant temporary buffs like speed boosts, shields, and area-of-effect attacks. Use them strategically to gain an edge over your opponents. </li>



<li> <strong>Know Your Weapons:</strong> Different weapons have different attack ranges and speeds. Experiment to find one that suits your playstyle. Some weapons can be thrown, allowing for ranged attacks. </li>



<li> <strong>Positioning is Key:</strong> Don&#8217;t just charge headfirst into battle. Use the environment to your advantage. Dodge attacks, weave through enemies, and use choke points on the map to take down foes. </li>



<li> <strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Venge.io has a high skill ceiling. The more you play, the better you&#8217;ll become at anticipating enemy movements, landing your attacks, and using power-ups effectively. </li>
</ol>

<p>Ballistic is a free online game developed by Arkadium. It is a puzzle game where you have to launch balls at targets to destroy them. The game has over 100 levels, and each level gets progressively more difficult.</p>



<p>To play Ballistic, you use the mouse to aim and launch the balls. You can also use the keyboard to control the game. The left and right arrow keys move the cannon, and the space bar launches the ball.</p>



<p>The goal of the game is to destroy all of the targets on the screen. You can do this by launching balls at them directly, or by ricocheting the balls off of other objects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform:capitalize">How to play Ballistic</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Start by aiming the cannon at the targets. You can do this by moving the mouse or using the left and right arrow keys.</li>



<li>Once you have aimed the cannon, click the mouse or press the space bar to launch the ball.</li>



<li>The ball will bounce off of walls and other objects. Use this to your advantage to ricochet the ball into the targets.</li>



<li>Destroy all of the targets on the screen to complete the level.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-transform:capitalize">tips for playing:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use the ricochet mechanic to your advantage. You can often destroy multiple targets with a single ball by ricocheting it off of walls and other objects.</li>



<li>Be careful not to launch the ball too hard. If you launch the ball too hard, it will bounce off of the walls and fly off the screen.</li>



<li>Use the power-ups to your advantage. Power-ups can help you to destroy targets more easily or to reach difficult areas.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ballistic is a fun and challenging puzzle game that is suitable for all ages. It is a great way to pass the time or to improve your problem-solving skills.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Play Free Sudoku online : one of the most popular puzzle games</h2>


<h2>Sudoku Easy</h2>
<p><strong>Sudoku for all players : from beginners to advanced players.</strong></p>
<p>If you like easy <strong>sudoku</strong> where you can have fun, enjoy, relax and pass your free time in a pleasant way you will love this game.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Hard</h2>
<p>If you like to raise big sudoku challenges and make your brain work hard, this classic sudoku game is also perfect for you.</p>
</p>
<h2>How to Play Sudoku</h2>
<h2>Sudoku rules</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sudoku</strong></span> is a lo`gic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classic Sudoku</a>, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.</p>
<h2>What are the 3 rules of Sudoku?</h2>
<p>Sudoku rules are simple and straightforward. It is precisely their simplicity that makes finding the solution and solving these puzzles a true challenge.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 1: Use Numbers 1-9</h2>
<p>Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces).<br />Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated?</p>
<p>As you can see from the image below of an actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the easier the game – the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 2: Don’t Repeat Any Numbers</h2>
<p>As you can see, in the upper left square (circled in blue), this square already has 7 out of the 9 spaces filled in. The only numbers missing from the square are 5 and 6. By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 3 : The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)</h2>
<p>A regular 9 x 9 grid is divided into 9 smaller blocks of 3 x 3, also known as nonets. The numbers from 1 to 9 can only occur once per nonet.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that the process of filling the rows and columns without duplicated digits finds inside each block another restriction to the numbers’ positioning.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Rule 4 : The sum of every single row, column and nonet must equal 45</h2>
<p>To find out which numbers are missing from each row, column or block or if there are any duplicates, the player can simply count or flex their math skills and sum the numbers. When the digits occur only once, the total of each row, column and group must be of 45.</p>
<h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
<p><strong>What is Sudoku solving algorithms?</strong></p>
<p>A standard Sudoku contains 81 cells, in a 9×9 grid, and has 9 boxes, each box being the intersection of the first, middle, or last 3 rows, and the first, middle, or last 3 columns.</p>
<p>Each cell may contain a number from one to nine, and each number can only occur once in each row, column, and box. A Sudoku starts with some cells containing numbers (clues), and the goal is to solve the remaining cells. Proper Sudokus have one solution. Players and investigators use a wide range of computer algorithms to solve Sudokus, study their properties, and make new puzzles, including Sudokus with interesting symmetries and other properties.</p>
<p>There are several computer algorithms that will solve 9×9 puzzles (n=9) in fractions of a second, but combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed, analyzed, and solved as n increases.</p>

</p>
<h3>What is Killer Sudoku?</h3>
<p>Killer Sudoku is a fun twist on the classic sudoku for those of you seeking something new and challenging. It’s also known by such names as sumdoku, addoku and sumoku puzzle but in a nutshell it’s pretty much the same number puzzle.</p>
<h4>What’s the difference between Sudoku and Killer Sudoku?</h4>
<p>Although both number puzzles share a lot of similarities, there’s also a major difference – amount of arithmetics involved.</p>
<p>In Killer Sudoku there’s a new concept of a “cage” – a group of cells within a dotted line that make up a sum shown as a small number above. Like in Sudoku, your ultimate goal is to fill the grid with numbers, while paying attention to ”the sum rule”.</p>
</p>
<h3>What is Sudoku Evil?</h3>
<p>Sudoku evil is a 9×9 grid sudoku puzzle with the highest possible level of difficulty. It’s an advanced level only for experienced sudoku solvers. Simple logic and basic knowledge of sudoku rules won’t cut it – you as a player should know advanced sudoku solving techniques and understand how to apply them in practice.</p>
<p>Even though evil sudoku is an extremely difficult game level, many experienced players find it the best way for brain training and developing mental skills.</p>
<h4>How to solve Sudoku Evil?</h4>
<p>The principle of the solution is the same as in the classic Sudoku. The goal is to fill the grid, so that each row, column, and 3&#215;3 block contain all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating. But in Evil Sudoku, there are much fewer numbers on the grid at the beginning. There&#8217;s going to be only 4 or even fewer numbers. This fact makes the evil sudoku level extremely difficult to solve.</p>
<p>The best way to solve the evil sudoku puzzle is to start with the blocks where there are more prearranged numbers. Such blocks are easier to complete compared to the ones with fewer numbers.</p>

And instead, researchers suggest people exercise more, socialise and make sure they get enough sleep if they want their mind to be sharper.</p> </div> </div>

<h2>Little Big Snake: A Fun and Addictive Multiplayer Game</h2>
<p>Little Big Snake is a multiplayer game that lets you control a snake or a flying beetle in a huge map full of food, bugs, and other players. You can eat the food and bugs to grow your size, skills, and abilities, and try to avoid or trap other players to eliminate them. You can also complete missions, level up, unlock skins and regalia, and evolve your snake with various upgrades. Little Big Snake is a fun and addictive game that builds on the success of similar games like Slither.io and Worms Zone, but adds more features and challenges to keep you entertained.</p>
<h2>How to Play Little Big Snake</h2>
<p>Little Big Snake is easy to play but hard to master. You can use your mouse to move your snake or flying beetle around the map, and left-click to boost your speed or make the beetle ascend. You can also use the space bar to boost your speed. Boosting consumes energy, which you can replenish by eating food or bugs.</p>
<p>The main goal of the game is to grow your snake as big as possible and survive as long as you can. You can do this by eating the glowing orbs and nectar that are scattered around the map, inside bugs, or left behind by other players. Eating food will also increase your score and level, which will unlock chests containing gold and other rewards.</p>
<p>You can also hunt other players by trying to encircle them with your body or cut off their path. If you make them crash into you, they will explode and drop their mass, which you can eat to grow faster. However, be careful not to crash into other players yourself, or you will die and lose your progress.</p>
<p>If you die as a snake, you will be reborn as a flying beetle. As a beetle, you can fly around the map and eat bubbles and slugs. You can also collect nectar to fill up a special bar that will allow you to return as a snake with some of your previous mass. However, you have to watch out for birds and spiders that will try to catch you.</p>
<h2>What Makes Little Big Snake Unique</h2>
<p>Little Big Snake is not just another snake game. It has several features that make it stand out from the crowd. Some of these features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beautiful graphics and sound effects:</strong> The game has a colorful and detailed map with various environments such as forests, deserts, oceans, and volcanoes. The game also has realistic sound effects that enhance the atmosphere and immersion.</li>
<li><strong>Variety of skins and regalia:</strong> You can customize your snake or beetle with hundreds of skins and regalia that you can unlock by playing the game, completing quests, opening chests, or buying them with gold or real money. You can also mix and match different parts of skins and regalia to create your own unique look.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution skill tree:</strong> You can improve your snake’s performance by spending gold on various upgrades in the evolution panel. You can choose from different branches such as speed, agility, vision, venom, magnetism, and more. Each upgrade will give you a permanent advantage in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Missions and achievements:</strong> You can challenge yourself by completing missions that will give you extra rewards such as gold, chests, skins, or regalia. You can also earn achievements that will show your progress and skills in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Team mode:</strong> You can team up with other players by joining or creating a team in the lobby. You can chat with your teammates, share nectar, help each other trap enemies, and compete against other teams in the leaderboard.</li>

</ul>
