But, when a game becomes a habit, it also brings in the uninvited elements of predictability and familiarity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Type in a word and press enter. All guesses must be real English words. After each guess each correct letter turns green and each correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow. Incorrect letters turn gray. Letters can be used more than once. Use these clues to help you guess the word.<\/p>\n<p>If you guess the correct word in 6 tries or less then you win. This game can only be played once per day. Check out the link in the description for where you can play it.<\/p>\n<h2>Can you get unlimited Wordle?<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s also Wordle Unlimited, which is exactly like Wordle except you can play as many times as you want in a day.<\/p>\n<h2>WordGuessr and social Wordle unlimited clone<\/h2>\n<p>Try to guess the correct word in 6 tries. Each guess is submitted by pressing the &#8216;ENTER&#8217; key. Once the guess is submitted, each correct letter in the correct position is shown in green G, each correct letter in the incorrect position is shown in orange O and letters that are not in the word show up in black B.<\/p>\n<h2>Wordguessr and Unlimited endless Wordle practice<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can do your Wordle practice training here with unlimited attempts.<\/li>\n<li>As my wife likes to say, \u201cPractice makes \u2018Pretty Good&#8217;\u201d.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to play Wordle<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Learn the rules to the online word game Wordle quickly and concisely &#8211; This video has no distractions, just the rules.<\/p>\n<h2>Games like Wordle + Best Spinoffs and Alternatives<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Wordle<\/strong><\/span> has steadily taken over the internet thanks to its simple yet challenging gameplay, but that\u2019s not to say the game is faultless.<\/p>\n<p>Among its main issues is that you can only tackle one <span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><a style=\"color: #00ccff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/tech\/category\/puzzle\/\"><strong>puzzle<\/strong><\/a><\/span> a day &#8211; and we&#8217;re here to help if you want <strong>today&#8217;s Wordle answer<\/strong>, by the way \u2013 if you\u2019re looking to try another puzzle you\u2019ll have to wait for the clock to tick over to tomorrow. Additionally, the game can get a bit repetitive; if you\u2019ve worked out the best starting words then you can pretty much guarantee a win within four tries.<\/p>\n<h3>Dordle like Wordle but two puzzles at once<\/h3>\n<p>Dordle is going to be the game for you.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s exactly the same as <strong>Wordle<\/strong> \u2013 using the same hint system and offering a new puzzle for you to attempt each day &#8211; except you are guessing two five-letter words at once.<br \/>To help you out just a little bit, <strong>Dordle<\/strong> gives you an extra attempt, increasing your total guess to seven rather than six.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, if you want to <strong>play<\/strong> more after attempting the <strong>daily puzzle<\/strong>, there is the option to keep going with the &#8216;free Dordle&#8217; mode.<\/p>\n<h3>Primel like Wordle for prime numbers&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s time to leave the letters behind and try out this all-numbers version of Wordle, <strong>Primel<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than trying to guess a five-letter word, you have to six attempts to work out a secret five-digit prime number. In case you&#8217;ve forgotten a prime number is one that can only be divided by one and itself, i.e. 11, 13, and 2,351.<br \/>Much <strong>like Wordle<\/strong>, you&#8217;re given the same hint system \u2013 a grey box means that digit isn&#8217;t in the number at all, yellow means you have the right digit in the wrong position, and green means you got the right digit in the right place.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, just like Wordle again you can attempt a new Primel puzzle every day.<\/p>\n<h3>Worldle like Wordle for countries<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Worldle<\/strong> puts your geography skills to the test by showing you the outline of a country and asking you to guess which one it is.<\/p>\n<p>If you guess incorrectly you\u2019re told how far away the answer is from the country you just typed, and which direction you\u2019ll have to travel from your location in order to get to your destination.<\/p>\n<p>Take note, however, as the distance you are shown is based on the distance between the country\u2019s centers, not between their borders. For example, the distance between the United States and Canada (which share a border) is given as 2,260km.<\/p>\n<p>Like Wordle, you only have six guesses and a new puzzle is available for you to play each day.<\/p>\n<h3>Squabble like Wordle but a battle royale<\/h3>\n<p>In <strong>Squabble<\/strong>, players are competing against each other to be the last person standing as they work to solve <strong>Wordle-style puzzles<\/strong> \u2013 with the same hint structure and ability to only attempt each word six times before being given a new one.<\/p>\n<p>You start off with 100 hit points and steadily lose it by guessing incorrectly or when other players get the correct answer. You also lose a hit point every second, so you can\u2019t dawdle. Thankfully, life can be regained by finding the right word.<\/p>\n<h3>Lewdle like Wordle for adults only<\/h3>\n<h6>Lewdle is a game about rude words.<\/h6>\n<p>If you&#8217;re likely to be offended by the use of profanity, vulgarity or obscenity, go play Wordle instead!<\/p>\n<p>Lewdle is the dirty version of the viral word-guessing game Wordle<br \/>The letter-guessing game has taken the world by storm, so it\u2019s no surprise copycats have emerged. This one offers a sweary twist<br \/>Players get six goes to guess a five-letter word. Colour-coding tells you which letters you have got wrong, which are right and which are right but in the wrong position.<\/p>\n<h3>Letterle like Wordle but just one letter<\/h3>\n<h6>Letterle is Wordle without the &#8216;word&#8217; bit<\/h6>\n<p>Letterle is a charming and daft take on the phenomenon which reduces it down to its constituent element: Guessing.<\/p>\n<p>Each day, Letterle chooses a new letter. Each day, you can have up to 26 attempts to guess it. Yes it&#8217;s absolutely absurd. But also, I got today&#8217;s Letterle in 8 attempts and that somehow feels like an affirmation of slight latent psychic abilities (If calling Wordle a guessing game annoys you, fair enough, and here&#8217;s actual strategies from people who think about it much more than I do).<\/p>\n<h3>Absurdle like Wordle but the game hates you<\/h3>\n<h6>Absurdle is a Wordle variant that is turning heads for its unconventional rules and gameplay.<\/h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Absurdle is an adversarial variant of the charming and (currently) viral word guessing game Wordle.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The mechanics of Absurdle are identical to Wordle, or as close as I can make them. Among other things, they use very similar word lists. (There are actually two word lists in Wordle: one is a list of 2,315 words which can appear as answers, and the other is a list of 10,657 rather more obscure words which are allowed as guesses but will never appear as answers.) The major difference is behind the scenes.<\/p>\n<p>Wordle picks a single secret word at the beginning of the game, and then you have to guess it. Absurdle gives the impression of picking a single secret word, but instead what it actually does is consider the entire list of all possible secret words which conform to your guesses so far. Each time you guess, Absurdle prunes its internal list as little as possible, attempting to intentionally prolong the game as much as possible.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h2>Wordle spinoffs<\/h2>\n<p>Thanks to Wordle&#8217;s success, ultimately leading to its acquisition by The New York Times , there have been several spinoffs to scratch that Wordle itch in different ways.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quordle<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This Wordle spinoff requires players to solve four five-letter words simultaneously. Players get nine guesses to complete the puzzle.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Octordle<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Players looking for an even greater challenge can try Octordle. The game requires players to figure out eight five-letter words in as many as 13 guesses.<\/p>\n<h3>Sedordle<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for an even greater challenge than Octordle, you can check out Sedordle, where players must attempt to solve 16 words at the same time. Players are given 21 tries to solve all 16 words.<\/p>\n<h3>Semantle<\/h3>\n<p>In Semantle, you guess a word and the game tells you how semantically similar that word is to the mystery word of the day. So rather than being about spelling, the game is about meaning, according to the game\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h3>Word Master<\/h3>\n<p>Like Wordle, Word Master tasks players with solving the mystery five-letter word within six tries.<\/p>\n<h3>Hello Wordl<\/h3>\n<p>Hello Wordl is like Wordle, but you can go up to 11-letter words, according to USA Today. You can also adjust the difficulty level.<\/p>\n<h3>Absurdle<\/h3>\n<p>Absurdle is a Wordle variation that tries to stump players as much as possible. With each guess, the game reveals as little information as possible, sometimes even changing the secret word, according to the game\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h3>Crosswordle<\/h3>\n<p>The goal of Crosswordle is to guess the two crossing words in as few guesses as possible. The two words are always connected in some way, according to the game\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h3>Lingle<\/h3>\n<p>Lingle is a six-letter Wordle game that requires players to guess the mystery six-letter word of the day. Players have seven tries to solve the puzzle.<\/p>\n<h4>Wordle fandom spinoffs<\/h4>\n<h4>Taylordle<\/h4>\n<p>Taylor Swift fans can play Taylordle, a word game devoted to the singer-songwriter. The mystery five-letter word is always connected to Swift \u2014 recent answers have included \u201calbum\u201d and \u201cblood.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Lordle of the Rings<\/h4>\n<p>This word game is for fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d According to the game\u2019s website, the mystery five-letter word of the day always comes from the main text of \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d which, considering the length of the series, isn\u2019t that much of a limitation.<\/p>\n<h4>SWordle<\/h4>\n<p>SWordle requires players to guess a mystery \u201cStar Wars\u201d-related word in six attempts. According to the game\u2019s website, the list of possible answers includes more than 14,000 words.<\/p>\n<h4>Mickeyrdle<\/h4>\n<p>This is a Disney-themed Wordle variation that requires players to guess a five-letter word connected to Disney \u2014 everything from movies to theme parks.<\/p>\n<h4>Squirdle<\/h4>\n<p>Squirdle is a Pokemon-themed Wordle that requires players to guess the name of a Pokemon in eight tries.<\/p>\n<h4>Scholardle<\/h4>\n<p>In Scholardle, players get five attempts to solve the mystery academic word of the day.<\/p>\n<h4>Trekle<\/h4>\n<p>Trekle is the same as Wordle except the words are all inspired by Star Trek. If you are not a fan of the films you might find this game extra challenging as a lot of the words belong exclusively to the franchise.<\/p>\n<p>This is a Wordle variation dedicated to \u201cStar Trek\u201d fans. The mystery word of the day increases in difficulty throughout the week starting on Sunday, according to the game\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h4>Weezle<\/h4>\n<p>In early March, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo announced the launch of Weezle, a Worldle-style game dedicated to the band\u2019s catalog \u2014 answers will always stem from a Weezer lyric.<\/p>\n<h4>Wizarding Wordle<\/h4>\n<p>Wizarding Wordle is for fans of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d universes.<\/p>\n<h4>BRDL<\/h4>\n<p>BRDL is a Wordle variation for bird enthusiasts, where only bird names are possible solutions to the puzzle each day. But unlike Wordle, the mystery word doesn\u2019t always have to be five letters.<\/p>\n<h3>Wordle for mathematicians<\/h3>\n<h4>Numble<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike Nerdle, Numble gives players the answer to the equation. Players then have six tries to guess the hidden equation.<\/p>\n<h4>Primel<\/h4>\n<p>Primel gives players six attempts to guess the mystery prime number of the day.<\/p>\n<h4>Wordle for geography buffs<\/h4>\n<h5>Globle<\/h5>\n<p>Globle requires players to guess the mystery country using the fewest number of guesses, although there is no limit on the number of attempts.<\/p>\n<h4>Worldle<\/h4>\n<p>Like Globle, Worldle also requires players to guess the correct country.<\/p>\n<h4>Byrdle<\/h4>\n<p>Byrdle is a Wordle variation where the answer will always be connected to choral music.<\/p>\n<h4>Poeltl<\/h4>\n<p>Poeltl (Wordle for sports fans) is an NBA player guessing game that gives players eight chances to guess the mystery player of the day.<\/p>\n<h4>Gordle<\/h4>\n<p>Gordle is a Wordle variation for hockey lovers. Each guess must be a five-letter last name of an NHL player past or present, according to the game\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h5>Wheeldle<\/h5>\n<p>Similar to Word Master, Wheeldle lets players tackle as many word puzzles as they want. Players are encouraged to build up streaks to see how many puzzles they can solve in a row. It&#8217;s also got a really cool retro video game vibe.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block\"><div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1648037556098\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Can you play Wordle more than once a day?<\/strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Wordle is limited to just one game per day, but users have discovered a simple trick which allows you to play again and find any old Wordles that may have been missed.<\/p> <\/div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1648037570371\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What&#8217;s the Wordle unlimited?<\/strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">As its name suggests, Wordle Unlimited is just Wordle without any limitations or bounding.
