In <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sudoku\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">classic Sudoku<\/a>, the objective is to fill a 9 \u00d7 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 \u00d7 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the 3 rules of Sudoku?<\/h2>\n<p>Sudoku rules are simple and straightforward. It is precisely their simplicity that makes finding the solution and solving these puzzles a true challenge.<\/p>\n<h2>Sudoku Rule 1: Use Numbers 1-9<\/h2>\n<p>Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 \u201csquares\u201d (made up of 3 x 3 spaces).<br \/>Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated?<\/p>\n<p>As you can see from the image below of an actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the easier the game \u2013 the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.<\/p>\n<h2>Sudoku Rule 2: Don\u2019t Repeat Any Numbers<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see, in the upper left square (circled in blue), this square already has 7 out of the 9 spaces filled in. The only numbers missing from the square are 5 and 6. By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.<\/p>\n<h2>Sudoku Rule 3 : The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)<\/h2>\n<p>A regular 9 x 9 grid is divided into 9 smaller blocks of 3 x 3, also known as nonets. The numbers from 1 to 9 can only occur once per nonet.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, this means that the process of filling the rows and columns without duplicated digits finds inside each block another restriction to the numbers\u2019 positioning.<\/p>\n<h2>Sudoku Rule 4 : The sum of every single row, column and nonet must equal 45<\/h2>\n<p>To find out which numbers are missing from each row, column or block or if there are any duplicates, the player can simply count or flex their math skills and sum the numbers. When the digits occur only once, the total of each row, column and group must be of 45.<\/p>\n<h2>Sudoku Solver<\/h2>\n<p><strong>What is Sudoku solving algorithms?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A standard Sudoku contains 81 cells, in a 9\u00d79 grid, and has 9 boxes, each box being the intersection of the first, middle, or last 3 rows, and the first, middle, or last 3 columns.<\/p>\n<p>Each cell may contain a number from one to nine, and each number can only occur once in each row, column, and box. A Sudoku starts with some cells containing numbers (clues), and the goal is to solve the remaining cells. Proper Sudokus have one solution. Players and investigators use a wide range of computer algorithms to solve Sudokus, study their properties, and make new puzzles, including Sudokus with interesting symmetries and other properties.<\/p>\n<p>There are several computer algorithms that will solve 9\u00d79 puzzles (n=9) in fractions of a second, but combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed, analyzed, and solved as n increases.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3>Sudoku Kingdom<\/h3>\n<p>Sudoku Kingdom is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Free online sudoku<\/strong><\/span> puzzles with 4 difficulty levels, Easy sudoku, Medium sudoku, Hard sudoku, very hard sudoku.<\/p>\n<h3>Sudoku 247<\/h3>\n<p>247 Sudoku is a one of popular websites offers all the difficulties a beginner or seasoned sudoku player will enjoy!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3>FREE Printable Sudoku Puzzles<\/h3>\n<p>Are you looking for free Sudoku puzzles to print?<\/p>\n<p>The printable sudoku puzzles pages below are listed in order of difficulty.<\/p>\n<p>If you are new to sudoku, start with an easy puzzle.

It\u2019s also known by such names as sumdoku, addoku and sumoku puzzle but in a nutshell it\u2019s pretty much the same number puzzle.<\/p>\n<h4>What\u2019s the difference between Sudoku and Killer Sudoku?<\/h4>\n<p>Although both number puzzles share a lot of similarities, there\u2019s also a major difference \u2013 amount of arithmetics involved.<\/p>\n<p>In Killer Sudoku there\u2019s a new concept of a \u201ccage\u201d \u2013 a group of cells within a dotted line that make up a sum shown as a small number above. Like in Sudoku, your ultimate goal is to fill the grid with numbers, while paying attention to \u201dthe sum rule\u201d.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<h3>What is Sudoku Evil?<\/h3>\n<p>Sudoku evil is a 9\u00d79 grid sudoku puzzle with the highest possible level of difficulty. It\u2019s an advanced level only for experienced sudoku solvers. Simple logic and basic knowledge of sudoku rules won\u2019t cut it \u2013 you as a player should know advanced sudoku solving techniques and understand how to apply them in practice.<\/p>\n<p>Even though evil sudoku is an extremely difficult game level, many experienced players find it the best way for brain training and developing mental skills.<\/p>\n<h4>How to solve Sudoku Evil?<\/h4>\n<p>The principle of the solution is the same as in the classic Sudoku. The goal is to fill the grid, so that each row, column, and 3&#215;3 block contain all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating. But in Evil Sudoku, there are much fewer numbers on the grid at the beginning. There&#8217;s going to be only 4 or even fewer numbers. This fact makes the evil sudoku level extremely difficult to solve.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to solve the evil sudoku puzzle is to start with the blocks where there are more prearranged numbers. Such blocks are easier to complete compared to the ones with fewer numbers.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block\"><div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1659794323544\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Is Sudoku good for your brain?<\/strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Taking a stab at Sudoku is another working-memory training activity.
