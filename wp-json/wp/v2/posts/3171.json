The game has won several awards, including the Apple Design Award and the BAFTA Award for Best Handheld\/Mobile Game. The game is available for devices using iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 operating systems, as well as desktop web browsers.<\/p>\n<p>The game\u2019s main character is Swampy, an alligator who lives in the sewers under the city. Swampy is different from the other alligators &#8211; he is curious, friendly and loves taking a shower. However, he faces trouble with the pipes and needs the player\u2019s help to get water to his shower.<\/p>\n<p>The game consists of four stories, each featuring a different character and theme. The stories are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swampy\u2019s Story<\/strong>: The original story where the player has to guide fresh water to Swampy\u2019s shower. The water can interact with various elements, such as dirt, algae, toxic water, steam and ooze. The player has to avoid obstacles and traps set by Cranky, Swampy\u2019s nemesis.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Allie\u2019s Story<\/strong>: A musical story where the player has to guide steam to Allie\u2019s steam-powered instrument. Allie is the sewer\u2019s most creative alligator and Swampy\u2019s girlfriend. She plays classic Disney tunes on her instrument and the player can sing along with her.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cranky\u2019s Story<\/strong>: A food-themed story where the player has to use dirty purple water to clear the algae on Cranky\u2019s plate. Cranky is a real gator\u2019s gator who has a big appetite and will eat anything, except his greens. He dislikes Swampy and Allie for being different and tries to sabotage their plans.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mystery Duck\u2019s Story<\/strong>: A special story where the player has to catch a fancy teleporting Mystery Duck. The Mystery Duck can appear in any level and has different abilities, such as changing size, shape and color. The player has to time their moves carefully to catch the duck.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each story has over 100 levels, each with a unique puzzle and challenge. The player can collect special items, such as rubber ducks and swampy items, that are hidden in each level. The player can also unlock bonus levels by completing certain tasks, such as tri-ducking (collecting all three ducks) or finding hidden objects.<\/p>\n<p>The game has a simple but engaging gameplay that appeals to players of all ages and skill levels. The game also has amazing graphics, animations and sound effects that create a realistic and immersive experience. The game also features original characters and stories that are humorous and charming.<\/p>\n<p>Where\u2019s My Water? is a game that combines physics, logic and creativity to create a fun and challenging puzzle game. The game has received positive reviews from critics and players alike, who praised its originality, variety and quality. The game has also spawned several spin-offs, such as Where\u2019s My Perry?, Where\u2019s My Mickey? and Where\u2019s My Water? 2.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for a game that will test your brain and entertain you at the same time, you should try Where\u2019s My Water?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Where\u2019s My Water? &#8211; A Fun and Challenging Puzzle Game Where\u2019s My Water?\u00a0is a puzzle game that was developed by Creature Feep and published by Disney Mobile in 2011.
