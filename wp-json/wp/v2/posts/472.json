So dordle is a word guessing game. Just like <strong>Wordle Dordle<\/strong> players are tasked to find a mystery word using a series of guesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The twist with Dordle is that players are trying to solve two words. Dordle has two different modes, you have free play or Daily Modes, The Daily Mode and free play work the same way. The only difference is that in daily mode players have the same word as everyone else for the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Free play mode, endlessly brings up random puzzles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When your play the game of dordle the rules are just the same as Wordle except for the fact that players are guessing for both words simultaneously. There are seven guesses available for both words together. Yellow squares mean that the letter is within the word in a different spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you ready to compete against yourself as you solve not one, but two hidden words at the same time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything you type will affect both boards at the same time, allowing you to advance much faster in your guessing. You will have a total of 7 attempts and you will have to guess 2 words of 5 letters each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the letters you write match those of the original word, they will turn yellow, but only if they are also in the correct position will they turn green. One of the advantages of this fun game is that you don\u2019t have to wait until the next day to continue playing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Test your mind, squeeze your brain and show the world what you are capable of. Have fun!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no hints as to what the words could be at first, but once you\u2019ve made a guess, the tiles will change colour, indicating whether you guessed a letter that appears in the word and whether you correctly placed the letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">First came Wordle Then came Dordle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among them is Dordle, a devious word game that doesn\u2019t let you off easy. You have to guess two five-letter words at the same time, but you can only input one word guess at a time. Confused? Play it and you\u2019ll get it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dordle comes from indie games developer Guilherme Tows, who works under the name Zaratustra Productions. Tows credits Wordle with inspiring Dordle, which is described as \u201cwordle plus wordle.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block\"><div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1650649402647\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What Is Dordle?<\/strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Dordle is very similar to word-guessing games like Wordle, with a distinct twist.
