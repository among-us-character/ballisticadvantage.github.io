{"id":4496,"count":1,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: left\">There are many strategic concepts in chess that strong players employ. Here are some of the most important:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">1. King safety - The king is the most valuable piece, so protecting it and avoiding checkmate is critical. Don't move the king out needlessly and avoid exposing it to attacks.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">2. Development - Move minor pieces (bishops and knights) and rooks out to active squares as quickly as possible so they can have maximum impact on the game. Develop pieces before capturing enemy pieces.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">3. Control the center - Try to occupy and control the central squares (d4, e4, d5 and e5) with pawns early in the game. Pieces on central squares have many options.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">4. Pawn structure - Pawn moves cannot be taken back, so maintain an organized, strong pawn structure that gives your pieces plenty of space and mobility. Avoid isolated, backward and doubled pawns.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">5. Space advantage - Try to control more space than your opponent by occupying central squares. This gives you more room for maneuvering pieces.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">6. Attack weaknesses - Target enemy pawns, pieces and structures that have little protection or mobility, but avoid trades that favor your opponent.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">7. Concretize the plan - Evaluate the position positionally to determine the best long-term approach, then focus on specific, executable tactics that help realize that strategy.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">8. Calculate variations - Study the possible consequences of moves by calculating several variations before deciding on the best choice. Even just a couple moves of foresight help a lot.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Those are some broad strategic concepts that players aim to incorporate into their overall game plans. Other aspects like target selection, piece coordination and endgame technique help shape chess strategies as well.
