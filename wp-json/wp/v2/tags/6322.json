This new mission puts players in the shoes of an Auschwitz inmate seeking to escape. Here is a step-by-step guide to survive and escape the horrors of Auschwitz in Call of Duty: WWII's new DLC.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Things You'll Need\r\n\u2022 Call of Duty: WWII game\r\n\u2022 Call of Duty: WWII \"War Machine\" DLC 4\r\n\u2022 Internet connection to download the DLC<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Understanding Auschwitz\r\nBefore jumping into the mission, take some time to read about the history of Auschwitz concentration camp. Understand what prisoners faced on a daily basis and the brutality of the Nazi guards. This will give you more context for the mission and things to look out for while playing.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Gather Resources and Intel\r\nAs you progress through the mission, search all areas thoroughly for any resources you can find like weapons, ammunition, health packs, clothing, etc. Every little bit can help during your escape attempt. Listen to conversations between Nazi guards for any possible clues or intel on blind spots, routes out of the camp, and times when security may be lax.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Stay Hidden and Escape detection\r\nWhile making your escape, avoid being seen by Nazi guards at all costs. Stick to the shadows, sneak around guards when possible, and only attack when you have the element of surprise. Every time you are detected, your chances of escape decrease significantly. Play slowly and methodically, prioritizing staying hidden over speed.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Work With Other Prisoners\r\nLook for opportunities to team up and work together with other prisoners throughout the mission. There is strength in numbers and other inmates may have skills or knowledge that complement your own strengths. However be wary of betrayals - trust must be earned along your journey to freedom.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><\/p>","link":"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/unblocked-games\/play\/call-of-duty-escape-auschwitz\/","name":"call of duty escape auschwitz","slug":"call-of-duty-escape-auschwitz","taxonomy":"post_tag","meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>call of duty escape auschwitz<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/unblocked-games\/play\/call-of-duty-escape-auschwitz\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"call of duty escape auschwitz\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Call of Duty WWII DLC 4: Escape from Auschwitz &#8211; A Survivor&#8217;s Guide Call of Duty: WWII released its final DLC named &#8220;War Machine&#8221; which includes a number of new maps and missions, including the controversial &#8220;Escape from Auschwitz&#8221; mission.
