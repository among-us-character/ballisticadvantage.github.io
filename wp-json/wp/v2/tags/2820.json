{"id":2820,"count":2,"description":"<p style=\"text-align: left\">Hero Wars is a popular turn-based role-playing mobile game developed and published by NEXTERS studio. The game features a large roster of heroes from different factions that you can collect and upgrade to build the ultimate team. This guide will cover the basics of Hero Wars to help you get started on your journey.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Getting Started\r\n<strong>Choose a Main Hero<\/strong>\r\nWhen you first open Hero Wars, you will need to choose a main hero that will become the leader of your team. The five starting heroes are:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">\u2022 Astaroth - A strong tank hero from the Order faction\r\n\u2022 K'arkh - A powerful damage dealer from the Dark faction\r\n\u2022 Dorian - A healer and support hero from the Mage faction\r\n\u2022 Martha - Another healer hero from the Angel faction\r\n\u2022 Jhu - A crowd control and damage dealer hero from the Outlander faction<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Choose the hero that best fits your playstyle and the heroes you find most interesting. You can obtain the other heroes later through various means in the game.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>Upgrade Your Team<\/strong>\r\nAfter choosing your main hero, collect the other four starting heroes and begin leveling them up. You can upgrade their skills, artifacts, and soul stones to make them stronger. Prioritize upgrading your main hero's skills and artifacts first.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>Focus on a Core Team<\/strong>\r\nAlthough you can obtain most heroes in Hero Wars, focus first on building a strong core team of 5-6 heroes. Strengthening a few top heroes will have a greater impact than spreading resources thinly among many heroes.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>Counter the Enemy Team<\/strong>\r\nDifferent factions have advantages and disadvantages against each other in Hero Wars. Consider the enemy team composition before combat and adjust your team accordingly. For example, Outlanders are strong against Angels but weak against Mages.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><\/p>","link":"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/unblocked-games\/play\/hero-wars\/","name":"hero wars","slug":"hero-wars","taxonomy":"post_tag","meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>hero wars<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/unblocked-games\/play\/hero-wars\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"hero wars\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Hero Wars is a popular turn-based role-playing mobile game developed and published by NEXTERS studio.
