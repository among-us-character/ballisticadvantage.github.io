The objective of the game is quite straightforward - try to evade being tagged or touched by the \"it\" player. Here are the basic steps to playing the game of tag:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">1. Decide on the boundaries and outdoor or indoor playing area. For outdoor tag, set a boundary line like a fence, rock, or tree. For indoor tag, set physical boundaries like rooms, hallways, furniture.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">2. Choose an \"it\" player. This can simply be done by having players take turns being \"it.\" Another option is finger on nose - the last player to put their finger on their nose becomes \"it.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">3. The \"it\" player chases the other players and tries to tag or touch one of them. Once a player is tagged, they become the new \"it\" and switch positions with the former \"it\" player.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">4. Avoid being tagged by jogging, running, dodging, and maneuvering around obstacles. Try some evasive action like sidestepping, spinning, or abruptly changing directions.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">5. Play resumes with the new \"it\" player chasing the others until another player is tagged.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">6. The round ends either after a set time limit or when all players have each had a turn as \"it.\" Players may then choose to start a new round or end the game.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">And that's the basic outline of how to play a game of tag. You can make it more interesting by adding tag backs where tagged players must then tag the player who tagged them, or have multiple \"it\" players chasing the others at once.<\/p>","link":"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/unblocked-games\/play\/tag-game\/","name":"tag game","slug":"tag-game","taxonomy":"post_tag","meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>tag game<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/unblocked-games\/play\/tag-game\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"tag game\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"How to Play the Classic Outdoor and Indoor Game of Tag Tag is a very simple yet fun game that kids and adults can enjoy.
