The island gradually shrinks, forcing players to move closer together and confront each other.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">To play, simply select the \"Battle Royale\" mode from the main menu. You will then be placed in a lobby with other players. Once the lobby is full, the game will start and you will be dropped onto the island.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">When you first land on the island, you will be unarmed. You must quickly search for weapons and other items to help you survive. Weapons can be found in chests, which are scattered throughout the island. You can also pick up weapons from defeated players.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">In addition to weapons, you can also find other items in Pixel Gun 3D: Battle Royale, such as armor, grenades, and healing kits. Armor will protect you from damage, grenades can be used to attack enemies, and healing kits can be used to restore your health.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">As the game progresses, the island will gradually shrink. This is known as the \"storm circle.\" If you are outside of the storm circle, you will start to take damage and eventually die. You must stay inside the storm circle to survive.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The last player standing in Pixel Gun 3D: Battle Royale wins the game. To win, you must eliminate all of the other players. You can do this by shooting them, melee attacking them, or throwing grenades at them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left\">Tips for playing Pixel Gun 3D: Battle Royale:<\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Land in a safe area. Avoid landing in areas with a lot of other players, as this is where the most fighting will take place.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">\r\nLoot quickly. Once you have landed, quickly search for weapons and other items. The faster you loot, the better equipped you will be for battle.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Stay inside the storm circle. The storm circle will shrink over time, so be sure to stay inside of it to avoid taking damage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Be aware of your surroundings. Always be on the lookout for other players, especially when you are outside of the storm circle.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Use cover to your advantage. Don't just run out into the open.
