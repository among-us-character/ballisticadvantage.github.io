Zephyr's 2nd skill, Windrun, allows him to move extremely fast and ignore unit collision, making him particularly effective at rushing lanes and destroying towers before the enemy team expects it. Following this tunnel rush Zephyr build and strategy can help you win lanes and snowball your advantage quickly in Dota 2 matches.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Items:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">- Iron Talon: Provides health and mana regen plus the Salve and Clarity active to keep you healthy during rushes. The Talon active allows you to cut down enemy creep waves faster.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">- Power Treads: The extra strength and attack speed helps you push towers down quickly. Switch to intelligence when casting spells.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">- Atos: Provides health plus a slow to kite enemies and immobilize heroes trying to stop your tower dives.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Skill Build:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Max Windrun first for the movement speed boost and evasion. Prioritize tailwind at early levels for extra burst damage on towers. Get one point in Static Link at level 3 then max it after Windrun.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Strategy:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">- Use Windrun to rush down an empty lane at early levels, targeting the nearest outer tower.\r\n- Pop an Iron Talon active to quickly clear the creep wave.\r\n- Activate your Power Treads for max damage and cast Tailwind when reaching the tower to burst it down.\r\n- If enemies rotate, use Static Link on the nearest hero then kite them with Windrun and Atos. Your team can then counter-rotate and gain an advantage.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">With this tunnel rush Zephyr build, you can quickly destroy towers, open up the map, and put pressure on the enemy team early in Dota 2.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlso read:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.virlan.co\/trending\/dota2-vs-lol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is Dota 2 better than League of Legends?
