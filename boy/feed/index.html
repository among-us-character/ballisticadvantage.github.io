<p>Poppy Playtime Game centers around a unique and genuinely terrifying narrative. They did something similar to the Five Nights at Freddy’s franchise: they took something that should be innocent and harmless–children’s animatronic toys–and made them demonic, murderous, and hungry for flesh. Poppy Playtime and Playtime Co. turn innocuous games like hide-and-seek or whack-a-mole into adrenaline-filled Squid Games, where you fight for your life and your sanity.</p>
<p>The game’s story is divided into multiple chapters and takes its sweet time unraveling any explanation. However, once you’ve played as many survival horror titles as we have, you learn to predict where a story is going. We’re excited to see each chapter’s twists and turns play out, but the pacing could be much better.</p>
<p>As for the toys in the facility, imagine Toys ‘R’ Us, but all the toys within turn on you. One of the first toys you encounter is this blue toy named Huggy Wuggy. Huggy Wuggy is colossal and consists of fur, bulging dilated eyes, and wide red lips formed into a smile. His image acts as a mascot for the company, spread through posters and walls around the establishment. He is automatically intimidating, solely from his size, and is full of surprises throughout the game.</p>

<p>Parents need to know that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Poppy Playtime Online</span> is a downloadable episodic horror adventure game available for Windows based PCs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players explore a seemingly abandoned toy factory, solving puzzles along the way, as they uncover the fate of the factory’s staff and also attempt to survive the experience. The controls are easy to pick up and play, though not always the most precise. While there’s no graphic violence or gore, there are splatters of blood throughout the factory. Also, the horror nature of the game will likely be too scary for younger audiences. Finally, parents should be aware that this is the first chapter of an episodic experience, meaning that it’s only part of the story and the rest must be purchased piecemeal over time.</p>
