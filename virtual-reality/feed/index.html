<p>Neon Pong is a virtual reality game that challenges players to use their reflexes and hand-eye coordination to keep a ball bouncing back and forth between two paddles. The game features three different game modes, each with its own unique challenges.</p>



<p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Basic Pong:</strong> This mode is the most basic way to play Neon Pong. Balls appear only in one color, and you have two paddles to hit them with. After each 30 seconds, a new wall of blocks will appear, so you must be quick to keep up.</li>



<li><strong>Speed Pong:</strong> This mode is more challenging than Basic Pong. The balls move faster, and there are more blocks to hit. You will need to be quick and accurate to keep up.</li>



<li><strong>Chaos Pong:</strong> This mode is the most challenging mode in Neon Pong. There are multiple balls of different colors, and the blocks are moving around the screen. You will need to be very precise to keep up.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>



<p>The controls for Neon Pong are simple. You use your VR controllers to move the paddles. You can also use your controllers to grab and throw the balls.</p>



<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>



<p>The graphics in Neon Pong are simple but effective. The neon colors and glowing blocks make the game look very cool.</p>



<p><strong>Sound</strong></p>



<p>The sound effects in Neon Pong are also simple but effective. The sound of the ball hitting the paddles and blocks is very satisfying.</p>



<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>



<p>Neon Pong is a fun and challenging VR game that will test your reflexes and hand-eye coordination. The game is easy to learn but hard to master, and it will keep you entertained for hours on end.</p>



<p><strong>How to Play Neon Pong</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Keep your paddles moving:</strong>&nbsp;The balls in Neon Pong move very quickly,&nbsp;so you need to keep your paddles moving in order to hit them.</li>



<li><strong>Use your wrists:</strong>&nbsp;Don&#8217;t try to move your paddles with your arms.&nbsp;Use your wrists to make quick and precise movements.</li>



<li><strong>Focus on the ball:</strong>&nbsp;Don&#8217;t worry about the blocks yet.&nbsp;Just focus on hitting the ball back and forth between the paddles.</li>
</ul>
