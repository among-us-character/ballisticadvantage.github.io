										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>My Pet Clinic: A Fun and Educational Game for Kids</h2>
<p>Do you love animals and want to learn how to take care of them? Do you dream of becoming a veterinarian someday? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you might enjoy playing My Pet Clinic, a game that lets you run your own pet clinic and treat different kinds of animals.</p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://www.virlan.co/video-games/crash-team-rumble-a-review-of-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crash Team Rumble, a Review of Reviews</a></p>
<p>The game is suitable for kids of all ages, as it has simple controls, colorful graphics and cute sounds. The game is also educational, as it teaches you about the basic needs and problems of various pets, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters and turtles.</p>
<p>The game has two modes: clinic mode and care mode. In clinic mode, you have to diagnose and treat the pets that come to your clinic. You have to use different tools and medicines to check their temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure, weight and other vital signs. You also have to perform minor surgeries, such as removing ticks, fleas, worms and splinters. You have to be quick and accurate, as the pets have a happiness meter that decreases if you make them wait too long or hurt them.</p>
<p>In care mode, you have to feed, groom and play with the pets that you have treated in the clinic mode. You have to give them the right food, water and toys according to their preferences. You also have to brush their fur, trim their nails and clean their ears. You have to make them happy and healthy, as they have a love meter that increases if you do a good job.</p>
<p>The game has many levels that increase in difficulty and variety. You have to treat more pets with more complex problems as you progress. You also have to manage your time and resources wisely, as you have a limited amount of money and supplies. You can earn more money by completing the levels successfully and use it to buy more tools, medicines and decorations for your clinic.</p>
<p>My Pet Clinic is a fun and educational game that will appeal to kids who love animals and want to learn more about them. The game will also help them develop their skills in observation, problem-solving, time management and empathy. The game is easy to play but challenging to master, making it a great way to spend some quality time online.</p>

</ul>
<p>In early 2022, a popular YouTuber and streamer named &#8220;IShowSpeed&#8221; played this game, becoming a famous meme on the internet due to his overwhelming and funny rivalry with <strong>Talking Ben</strong>.</p>
<p>The meme mostly shows IShowSpeed asking Ben controversial questions on a telephone such as, if he loves God, if he supports LGBTQ, does he support Black Lives Matter, etc. He somewhat argues and yells at him aggressively whenever he replied a negative response. Ben and his app became the first popular meme to be from Outfit7.</p>
</p>
<h3>How do you get talking Ben to talk?</h3>
<p>Ben is a retired chemistry professor who likes his quiet comfortable life of eating, drinking and reading newspapers. To make him responsive, you will have to bother him long enough that he will fold his newspaper. Then you can talk to him, poke or tickle him or even have a telephone conversation with him.</p>
<p>If you get <strong>Ben</strong> to his laboratory however, he becomes as happy as a puppy. There you can do chemistry experiments by mixing a combination of two test tubes together and see the hilarious reactions.</p>

<h3>Talking Ben</h3>
<p>I’m Ben. I’m a genius. Blunt, yes, but true! I do have hidden depths though. I’m a very funny guy, for example. Although, to be fair, I haven’t actually received external confirmation of that yet… So it’s just a hypothesis at the moment. But still! Funny AND smart.</p>
<p>My inventions are going to put our app studio on the map! Well, the ones that don’t explode that is… But that only happened once… (Or twice.) Inventing is easy as pie for me. It’s as easy as breathing. What’s hard is getting Tom to clean up after himself. Or say thank you every now and again! I’m working on it though. It’s my greatest challenge yet!</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff9900;">Why PBS Kids is so popular?</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>PBS Kids is the brand for most of the children&#8217;s programming aired by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some public television children&#8217;s programs are not produced by PBS member stations or transmitted by PBS.</p>
<p>Instead, they are produced by independent public television distributors such as American Public Television, and are not labeled as &#8220;PBS Kids&#8221; programming, as it is mainly a programming block branding.</p>
<p>The target audience is <strong>children</strong> between the ages of 2 and 8. The network is also available in sub-Saharan Africa and Australia.</p>
